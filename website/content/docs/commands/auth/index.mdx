# auth

The `auth` command groups subcommands for interacting with OpenBao's auth methods.
Users can list, enable, disable, and get help for different auth methods.

For more information, please see the [auth method
documentation](../../auth/index.mdx) or the [authentication
concepts](../../concepts/auth.mdx) page.

To authenticate to OpenBao as a user or machine, use the [`bao login`](../login.mdx) command instead. This command is for
interacting with the auth methods themselves, not authenticating to OpenBao.

## Examples

Enable an auth method:

```shell-session
$ bao auth enable userpass
Success! Enabled userpass auth method at: userpass/
```

List all auth methods:

```shell-session
$ bao auth list
Path         Type        Description
----         ----        -----------
token/       token       token based credentials
userpass/    userpass    n/a
```

Get help about how to authenticate to a particular auth method:

```shell-session
$ bao auth help userpass/
Usage: bao login -method=userpass [CONFIG K=V...]
# ...
```

Disable an auth method:

```shell-session
$ bao auth disable userpass/
Success! Disabled the auth method (if it existed) at: userpass/
```

Tune an auth method:

```shell-session
$ bao auth tune -max-lease-ttl=30m userpass/
Success! Tuned the auth method at: userpass/
```

## Usage

```text
Usage: bao auth <subcommand> [options] [args]

  # ...

Subcommands:
    disable    Disables an auth method
    enable     Enables a new auth method
    help       Prints usage for an auth method
    list       Lists enabled auth methods
    tune       Tunes an auth method configuration
```
