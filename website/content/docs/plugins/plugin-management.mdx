# Plugin Management

External plugins are the components in OpenBao that can be implemented separately
from OpenBao's built-in plugins. These plugins can be either authentication or
secrets engines.

The [`api_addr`][api_addr] must be set in order for the plugin process to
establish communication with the OpenBao server during mount time. If the storage
backend has HA enabled and supports automatic host address detection, OpenBao
will automatically attempt to determine the `api_addr` as well.

Detailed information regarding the plugin system can be found in the
[internals documentation](index.mdx).

## Plugin distribution methods

OpenBao supports two methods for distributing external plugins:

1. **Manual management** - Manual download of plugin binaries
2. **OCI-based distribution** - Automatic download from container registries
   with declarative configuration. See the [OCI
   Plugin](/docs/configuration/oci-plugins) configuration reference for complete
   documentation.

Both methods require the plugin to be registered in OpenBao before it can be used.

## Registering external plugins

Before an external plugin can be mounted, it needs to be
[registered](plugin-architecture.mdx#plugin-registration) in the
plugin catalog to ensure the plugin invoked by OpenBao is authentic and maintains
integrity:

```shell-session
$ bao plugin register -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
    secret \                  # type
    passthrough-plugin

Success! Registered plugin: passthrough-plugin
```

## Enabling/Disabling external plugins

After the plugin is registered, it can be mounted by specifying the registered
plugin name:

```shell-session
$ bao secrets enable -path=my-secrets passthrough-plugin
Success! Enabled the passthrough-plugin secrets engine at: my-secrets/
```

Listing secrets engines will display secrets engines that are mounted as
plugins:

```shell-session
$ bao secrets list
Path         Type       Accessor            Plugin              Default TTL  Max TTL  Force No Cache  Replication Behavior  Description
my-secrets/  plugin     plugin_deb84140     passthrough-plugin  system       system   false           replicated
```

Disabling an external plugins is identical to disabling a built-in plugin:

```shell-session
$ bao secrets disable my-secrets
```

## Upgrading plugins
