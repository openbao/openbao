# `/sys/unseal`

The `/sys/unseal` endpoint is used to unseal the OpenBao.

## Submit unseal key

This endpoint is used to enter a single root key share to progress the
unsealing of the OpenBao. If the threshold number of root key shares is reached,
OpenBao will attempt to unseal the OpenBao. Otherwise, this API must be called
multiple times until that threshold is met.

Either the `key` or `reset` parameter must be provided; if both are provided,
`reset` takes precedence.

| Method | Path          |
| :----- | :------------ |
| `POST` | `/sys/unseal` |

### Parameters

- `key` `(string: "")` – Specifies a single root key share. This is required
  unless `reset` is true.

- `reset` `(bool: false)` – Specifies if previously-provided unseal keys are
  discarded and the unseal process is reset.

- `migrate` `(bool: false)` - Available in 1.0 - Used to migrate the seal
  from shamir to autoseal or autoseal to shamir. Must be provided on all unseal
  key calls.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "key": "abcd1234..."
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/unseal
```

### Sample response

The "t" parameter is the threshold, and "n" is the number of shares.

```json
{
  "sealed": true,
  "t": 3,
  "n": 5,
  "progress": 2,
  "version": "0.6.2"
}
```

Sample response when OpenBao is unsealed.

```json
{
  "sealed": false,
  "t": 3,
  "n": 5,
  "progress": 0,
  "version": "0.6.2",
  "cluster_name": "openbao-cluster-d6ec3c7f",
  "cluster_id": "3e8b3fec-3749-e056-ba41-b62a63b997e8"
}
