# Support control groups for authorizing paths

## Summary

This feature would implement second-party authorization for protected
resources. A control-group restriction placed on a path would require
a user to obtain prior authorization before the action would succeed.

Using the control group feature would follow this general pattern, via API
endpoints:

1. A path is assigned a control-group policy
2. Access to the path is denied without control group authorization
3. A user belonging to the control group can authorize the resource for a particular entity
4. Access to the path is now permitted only to the authorized entity for some duration

A second phase might add a request/notification workflow, but this is not essential:
1. A user requests access to the protected resource
2. Members of the control group receive a notification of the request (on logging in to OpenBao web UI?)
3. The original requester receives notification of the control-group approval when it occurs

## Problem Statement

An organization wants to review access to certain paths (eg, pki
issuance, etc) on a case-by-case basis, and/or requires a "second set
of eyes" to approve access to a path. The reviewers are indicated by
specifying a "control group", whose member can grant access (by using
an endpoint). However, the control group members should not be able to
grant their own personal access.

## User-facing Description

## Technical Description

The control group implementation might consist of the following.
1. A control-group policy:
   1. Denies data access by default
   2. Allows authorizing action to control group members
   3. Allows data access to authorized requester
2. An authorizing endpoint:
   1. Applies to path
   2. Applies to user/entity
   3. Is time-limited
   4. Self authorization not permitted
3. Authorization storage (how do we maintain the "authorization" state over time?):
   1. Metadata on the path?
   2. Separate storage mount for authorizations?

When the policy is "checking authorization", we'd need to read the
authorization storage. This might be simplest if the metadata of the
path in question contains authorizations (no need to access a second
location).

For workflow, we might need a "requests" storage as well.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This is essentially "assigning a policy to a resource and a user"
which allows access -- which is something we can already do in OpenBao
with roles/policies/etc. However, the control-group concept has some
additional value:

1. The administrator can delegate authorization responsibility to a
   group, any member of which can grant access
2. By inhibiting self-approval, the control group policy can ensure "second set of eyes"
3. A workflow for requesting/granting in the UI might make admistration easier
