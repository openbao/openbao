# RFC: CEL Expression Support for JWT Authentication

## Summary

This feature offers support for [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) in OpenBao's jwt-based auth engines (oidc, jwt) to create a flexible framework for validating claims and dynamically assigning token policies. CEL will allow administrators to define fine-grained rules for claim validation and dynamic policy assignment, extending the more static assignment of role- and identity-based policies.

JWT CEL support is implemented as a new type of CEL role and follows the [general plan for CEL support](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/website/content/docs/rfcs/cel-best-practices.mdx) in OpenBao.

## Problem Statement

OpenBao's jwt-based auth engines (OIDC and JWT) currently assemble token policies from `roles` and `identities`. However, administrators cannot enforce complex constraints, such as validating combinations of claims or dynamically assigning token policies based on claim values.

---

## User-facing description

**_Administrators_** can define CEL roles under a new endpoint, `auth/{oidc|jwt}/cel/roles/:name`, to be executed during authentication. CEL roles should evaluate all incoming claims and generate `logical.Auth{}` instances having appropriate token policies.

**_Users_** authenticating with JWT or OIDC tokens will have their claims validated through the CEL inidicated role. If successful, they receive a token with policies and other attributes. 

For example:

- A CEL role validates that the token contains specific claims like `"admin" in claims.roles && matches(claims.tenant_id, [0-9]+)"`.
- If validation passes, the CEL program assigns the token policies `admin` and `team-12345` (using `claims.tenant_id` to form the policy name).

This could be codified in the following CEL program:
```json
"admin" in claims.roles && matches(claims.tenant_id, [0-9]+)" ? pb.Auth{ policies: ["admin", "team-12345"] } : false
```

## Technical Description

### CEL in Vault Auth Engines (OIDC, JWT)

CEL roles integrate with OpenBao's Auth engine (OIDC and JWT) to dynamically evaluate claims. Instead of using static role-to-policy assignment with `bound_claim`, CEL programs validate claims and return a `logical.Auth` instance containing dynamically assigned token policies.

**Workflow:**
1. A user authenticates with a JWT or OIDC token.
2. The incoming claims are passed to the CEL role for validation.
3. If the CEL policy evaluates successfully:
    - A `logical.Auth` instance is returned.
    - Token policies are assigned dynamically based on the CEL program logic.
4. If validation fails, `false` or `string` (error message) is returned and token is not generated.

### **API Endpoints**

| Use                      | Method   | Path                       |
|--------------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| List CEL roles           | `LIST`   | `auth/jwt/cel/roles`       |
| Retrieve a specific CEL role | `GET`    | `auth/jwt/cel/roles/:name` |
| Create a CEL role        | `POST`   | `auth/jwt/cel/roles/:name` |
| Update a CEL role        | `PATCH`  | `auth/jwt/cel/roles/:name` |
| Delete a CEL role        | `DELETE` | `auth/jwt/cel/roles/:name` |
| Login with CEL role      | `POST`   | `auth/jwt/cel/login role=:name jwt=:jwt`|

### CEL Role Format
A CEL role is defined as a JSON object with the following fields:
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "cel_program": {
    "variables": [
      {
        "name": "string",
        "expression": "string"
      }
    ],
    "expression": "string",
  },
  "expiration_leeway": "int",
  "not_before_leeway": "int",
  "clock_skew_leeway": "int",
  "bound_audiences": [
    "string"
  ],
}
```


The following parameters are supplied by the CEL policy engine and may be used in the expression:

- `claims` `(map[string]any: required)`  
  All claims present in the incoming JWT or OIDC token.

### CEL Reply Format (CEL role to Auth Engine)

The CEL role engine evaluates the claims and returns a `logical.Auth` object or error that determines the authenticated user's token and policies.

The CEL expression itself may return one of the following:
- `pb.Auth` `(protobuf Auth: optional)`  
  A `logical.Auth` instance containing the following fields:
    - `policies` `([]string: required)`  
      List of token policies assigned to the user.
    - `lease_duration` `(int: required)`  
      Duration (in seconds) for which the token is valid.
    - `renewable` `(bool: required)`  
      Whether the token is renewable.
- `bool`(false: optional)
  A boolean false value indicates failed authorization.
- `string` `(Error: optional)`  
  A detailed error when the program fails.
- 

## Rationale and alternatives

Dynamic policy assignment can be implemented using templating for [ACLs](https://openbao.org/api-docs/auth/jwt/#acl-policy-templating-examples), but the expressiveness of CEL is much greater.

Some form CEL or regex evaluation could be added to existing role instead of creating a new type, as with [glob matching](https://openbao.org/api-docs/auth/jwt/#createupdate-role) for `bound_claims`. 

Alternatively, a web hook approach like [Vault's CIEPS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/pki/cieps) could be used to achieve similar flexibility. However, the performance implications and system brittleness make this an unattractive alternative.

## Downsides

Additional complexity of a new type; not backwards compatible with Vault.

# Set up identity

# Obtain a JWT
export BAO_TOKEN=$(bao login -field=token -method=userpass username=testing password=testing)
export JWT=$(bao read identity/oidc/token/example -format=json | jq -r ".data.token")
