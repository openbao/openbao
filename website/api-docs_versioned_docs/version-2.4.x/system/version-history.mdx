# `/sys/version-history`

The `/sys/version-history` endpoint is used to retrieve the version history of an OpenBao instance.

## Read version history

This endpoint returns the version history of the OpenBao. The response will contain the following keys:

- `keys`: a list of installed versions in chronological order based on the time installed
- `key_info`: a map indexed by the versions found in the `keys` list containing the following subkeys:
  - `build_date`: the time (in UTC) at which the OpenBao binary used to run the OpenBao server was built.
  - `previous_version`: the version installed prior to this version or `null` if no prior version exists
  - `timestamp_installed`: the time (in UTC) at which the version was installed
