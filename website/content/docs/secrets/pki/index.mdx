# PKI secrets engine

:::warning

**Note**: This engine can use external X.509 certificates as part of TLS or signature validation.
   Verifying signatures against X.509 certificates that use SHA-1 is deprecated and is no longer
   usable without a workaround. See the
   [deprecation FAQ](../../deprecation/faq.mdx#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1)
   for more information.

:::info

**OpenBao as Consul CA provider:** If you are using OpenBao as a Connect CA,
run a Consul version greater than 1.12.8.

:::

The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets
engine, services can get certificates without going through the usual manual
process of generating a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for
a verification and signing process to complete. OpenBao's built-in authentication
and authorization mechanisms provide the verification functionality.

By keeping TTLs relatively short, revocations are less likely to be needed,
keeping CRLs short and helping the secrets engine scale to large workloads. This
in turn allows each instance of a running application to have a unique
certificate, eliminating sharing and the accompanying pain of revocation and
rollover.

In addition, by allowing revocation to mostly be forgone, this secrets engine
allows for ephemeral certificates. Certificates can be fetched and stored in
memory upon application startup and discarded upon shutdown, without ever being
written to disk.

## Table of contents

The PKI Secrets Engine documentation is split into the following pieces:

 - [Overview](index.mdx) - this document.
 - [Setup and Usage](setup.mdx) - a brief description of setting
   up and using the PKI Secrets Engine to issue certificates.
 - [Quick Start - Root CA Setup](quick-start-root-ca.mdx) - A
   quick start guide for setting up a root CA.
 - [Quick Start - Intermediate CA Setup](quick-start-intermediate-ca.mdx) - A
   quick start guide for setting up an intermediate CA.
 - [Considerations](considerations.mdx) - A list of helpful
   considerations to keep in mind when using and operating the PKI Secrets
   Engine.
 - [Troubleshooting ACME](troubleshooting-acme.mdx) - A list of
   advice for troubleshooting failures with ACME issuance and OpenBao PKI.
 - [Rotation Primitives](rotation-primitives.mdx) - A document
   which explains different types of certificates used to achieve rotation.
