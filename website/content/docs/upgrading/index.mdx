# Upgrading OpenBao

These are general upgrade instructions for OpenBao for both non-HA and HA setups.
_Please ensure that you also read any version-specific upgrade notes which can be
found in the sidebar._

!> **Important:** Always back up your data before upgrading! OpenBao does not
make backward-compatibility guarantees for its data store. Simply replacing the
newly-installed OpenBao binary with the previous version will not cleanly
downgrade OpenBao, as upgrades may perform changes to the underlying data
structure that make the data incompatible with a downgrade. If you need to roll
back to a previous version of OpenBao, you should roll back your data store as
well.

OpenBao upgrades are designed such that large jumps (ie 1.3.10 -> 1.7.x) are
supported. The upgrade notes for each intervening version must be reviewed. The
upgrade notes may describe additional steps or configuration to update before,
during, or after the upgrade.

## Integrated storage autopilot

Vault 1.11 introduced [automated
upgrades](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot#automated-upgrades) as
part of the Integrated Storage Autopilot feature. If your Vault environment is
configured to use Integrated Storage, consider leveraging this new feature to
upgrade your Vault environment.

-> **Tutorial:** Refer to the [Automate Upgrades with Vault
 Enterprise](/vault/tutorials/raft/raft-upgrade-automation)
 tutorial for more details.

## Agent

The OpenBao Agent is an API client of the OpenBao Server. OpenBao APIs are almost
always backwards compatible. When they are not, this is called out in the
upgrade guide for the new OpenBao version, and there is a lengthy deprecation
period. The OpenBao Agent version can lag behind the OpenBao Server version, though
we recommend keeping all OpenBao instances up to date with the most recent minor OpenBao version
to the extent possible.

## Testing the upgrade

It's always a good idea to try to ensure that the upgrade will be successful in
your environment. The ideal way to do this is to take a snapshot of your data
and load it into a test cluster. However, if you are issuing secrets to third
party resources (cloud credentials, database credentials, etc.) ensure that you
do not allow external network connectivity during testing, in case credentials
expire. This prevents the test cluster from trying to revoke these resources
along with the non-test cluster.

## Upgrading from Community to Enterprise editions

Upgrading to Vault Enterprise installations follow the same steps as Community edition upgrades except that the Vault Enterprise binary is to be used and the license file [applied](/vault/api-docs/system/license#install-license), when applicable. The Enterprise binary and license file can be obtained through your HashiCorp sales team.

## Non-HA installations

Upgrading non-HA installations of OpenBao is as simple as replacing the OpenBao
binary with the new version and restarting OpenBao. Any upgrade tasks that can be
performed for you will be taken care of when OpenBao is unsealed.

Always use `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` to properly shut down OpenBao.

Be sure to also read and follow any instructions in the version-specific
upgrade notes.

## HA installations

The recommended upgrade procedure depends on the version of OpenBao you're currently on and the storage backend of OpenBao. If you're currently running on Vault 1.11 or later with Integrated Storage and you have Autopilot enabled, you should let Autopilot do the upgrade for you, as that's easier and
less prone to human error. Please refer to our [automated
upgrades](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot#automated-upgrades) documentation for information on this feature and our
[Automate Upgrades with Vault
Enterprise](/vault/tutorials/raft/raft-upgrade-automation)
tutorial for more details.

If you're currently on a version of Vault before 1.11, or you've chosen to opt-out the Autopilot automated upgrade features when running Vault after 1.11 with Integrated Storage, or if you are running Vault with other storage backend such as Consul. Please refer to our [Vault HA upgrades Pre 1.11/Without Autopilot Upgrade Automation](/vault/docs/upgrading/vault-ha-upgrade) documentation for more details. Please note that this upgrade procedure also applies if you are upgrading Vault from pre 1.11 to post 1.11.

## Enterprise replication installations

<Note>

Prior to any upgrade, be sure to also read and follow any instructions in the
version-specific upgrade notes which are found in the navigation menu for this
documentation.

</Note>

Upgrading Vault Enterprise clusters which participate in [Enterprise
Replication](/vault/docs/enterprise/replication) requires the following basic
order of operations:

- **Upgrade the replication secondary instances first** using appropriate
  guidance from the previous sections
- Verify functionality of each secondary instance after upgrading
- When satisfied with functionality of upgraded secondary instances, upgrade
  the primary instance

<Note>

It is not safe to replicate from a newer version of Vault to an older version.
When upgrading replicated clusters, ensure that upstream clusters are always on
older versions of Vault than downstream clusters.

</Note>

Here is an example of upgrading four Vault replicated Vault clusters:

![Upgrading multiple replicated clusters](/img/vault-replication-upgrade.png)

In the above scenario, the ideal upgrade procedure would be as follows,
verifying functionality after each cluster upgrade.

1. Upgrade Clusters B and D. These clusters have no downstream clusters, so they
   should be upgraded first, but the ordering of B vs D does not matter.
2. Upgrade Cluster C, which now has an upgraded downstream cluster (Cluster D).
   Because Cluster C is a cluster, it should also use the HA upgrade process.
3. Finally, upgrade Cluster A. All clusters downstream of A will already be
   upgraded. It should be upgraded last, as it is a Performance Primary and a DR
   Primary.
