# Declarative Audit Devices

The `audit` stanza allows definition of [audit devices](/docs/audit) from the
OpenBao server configuration file. These audit devices are created and removed
on the active node during restarts and `SIGHUP` events. Audit devices cannot
be modified and cannot duplicate existing API-created devices. Removal of the
configuration stanza will result in the audit device being removed; it is
important to have the same configuration across all servers.

# `audit` stanza

The `audit` stanza specifies various configurations for OpenBao to create
new audit devices. It takes two keyword parameters: `type`, the type of the
audit device to create; and `path`, the path of the audit device in the root
namespace. Devices take [the same parameters](/api-docs/system/audit) as
the API: `description` and other parameters are defined at the top level and
`options` for the audit device is a `string->string` map.

  ]
}
```

audit "file" "to-stdout" {
  description = "This audit device should never fail."
  options {
    file_path = "/dev/stdout"
    log_raw = "true"
  }
}
```

</Tabs>

Multiple `audit` stanzas may exist and are executed in the order they
are specified in the configuration file(s). No two blocks may share the
same `path`.
