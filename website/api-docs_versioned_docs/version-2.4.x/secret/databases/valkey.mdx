# Valkey database plugin HTTP API

The Valkey database plugin is one of the supported plugins for the database
secrets engine. This plugin generates database credentials dynamically based on
configured roles for the Valkey database.

## Configure connection

In addition to the parameters defined by the [Database
Secrets Engine](/api-docs/secret/databases#configure-connection), this plugin
has a number of parameters to further configure a connection.

| Method | Path                     |
| :----- | :----------------------- |
| `POST` | `/database/config/:name` |

### Parameters

- `host` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the host to connect to.

- `port` `(int: <required>)` – Specifies the port number of the connection.

- `username` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the username for OpenBao to use.

- `password` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the password corresponding to the given username.

- `tls` `(bool: false)` – Specifies whether to use TLS when connecting to Valkey.

- `insecure_tls` `(bool: false)` – Specifies whether to skip verification of the
server certificate when using TLS.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "plugin_name": "valkey-database-plugin",
  "host": "localhost://127.0.0.1",
  "username": "user",
  "password": "pass",
  "allowed-roles": "my-*-role"
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/database/config/valkey
```

## Statements

Statements are configured during role creation and are used by the plugin to
determine what is sent to the database on user creation, renewing, and
revocation. For more information on configuring roles see the [Role
API](/api-docs/secret/databases#create-role) in the database secrets engine docs.

### Parameters

The following are the statements used by this plugin. If not mentioned in this
list the plugin does not support that statement type.

- `creation_statements` `(list: [])` – Specifies a JSON string containing
[Valkey ACL rules](https://valkey.io/commands/acl-cat) to assign to created users. If not provided, defaults to
a read-only user that can read any key.
