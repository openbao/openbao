## List pagination

When implementing listing, it is recommended to use pagination so that items are 
processed in increments rather than loading the entire set into memory at once. 
Learn more in [rfcs/paginated-lists](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/paginated-lists/). 
`HandleListPage(...)` is a helper introduced in [PR #781](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/781) 
to streamline list pagination across implementations. It supports both item-level 
and batch-level callbacks for flexibility:

- **`itemCallback(...)`**: Processes individual entries within a page.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
     - `index` (int): The index of the entry within the current page.
     - `entry` (*logical.StorageEntry): The current storage entry being processed.
   - **Returns**:
     - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further entries.
     - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

- **`batchCallback(...)`**: Executes after processing all entries in a page.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
     - `entries` ([]*logical.StorageEntry): All entries in the current batch.
   - **Returns**:
     - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further pages.
     - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

The callbacks are executed sequentially, with `itemCallback` processing each entry individually,
followed by `batchCallback` handling the entire batch.

## Listing Detailed Endpoints

Detailed listing of items is implemented using one of the following two methods:
- Supplying the `-detailed` CLI flag.
- Querying a `/detailed` API endpoint.

While both approaches are valid, it is recommended to implement a dedicated `/detailed` endpoint, as 
done in the `pki/certs/detailed` implementation ([PR #680](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/680)).

This has the following benefits:
* Avoids adding performance overhead on the default list endpoint. For example, in `pki/issuers`, 
the list API always returns both the list of `keys` and a `key_info` map containing metadata for each 
issuer. The `-detailed` flag simply controls whether this metadata is displayed in the CLI output.
* Restricts access to detailed listing by default unless an administrator has set up wildcards. For
instance, when using `- detailed`, an admin who doesn't want users listing detailed information 
(because it is too resource intensive) would need to explicitly update their ACL policies to include 
`denied_parameters=detailed`.
