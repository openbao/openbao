# OpenBao UI browser support

OpenBao currently supports all 'evergreen' and updated browsers. The following browsers are supported:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

:::danger

**Warning**: Using an unsupported browser such as Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) may cause degradation in feature functionality, and in some cases, OpenBao features may not operate. We encourage using one of the supported browsers listed for OpenBao UI.

:::

Please note that OpenBao, in alignment with Microsoft's stance on IE 11, no longer supports Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11). For further information on IE 11, please reference Microsoft's [support site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge).
