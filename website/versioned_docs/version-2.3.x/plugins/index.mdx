# Plugin system

OpenBao supports 3 types of plugins; auth methods, secret engines, and database
plugins. This concept allows both built-in and external plugins to be treated
like building blocks. Any plugin can exist at multiple different mount paths.
Different versions of a plugin may be at each location, with each version differing
from OpenBao's version.

A plugin is uniquely identified by its type (one of `secret`, `auth`, or
`database`), name (e.g. `kv`), and version (e.g `v1.0.0`). An empty version
implies either the built-in plugin or the single unversioned plugin that can
be registered.

See [Plugin Upgrade Procedure](/docs/upgrading/plugins#plugin-upgrade-procedure)
for details on how to upgrade a built-in plugin in-place.

## Built-In plugins

Built-in plugins are shipped with OpenBao, often for commonly used integrations,
and can be used without any prerequisite steps.

## External plugins

External plugins are not shipped with OpenBao and require additional operator
intervention to run.

To run an external plugin, a binary of the plugin is required. Plugin
binaries can be obtained from [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/)
or they can be [built from source](/docs/plugins/plugin-development#building-a-plugin-from-source).

OpenBao's external plugins are completely separate, standalone applications that
OpenBao executes and communicates with over RPC. Each time an OpenBao secret engine,
auth method, or database plugin is mounted, a new process is spawned. However,
plugins can be made to implement [plugin multiplexing](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-multiplexing)
to improve performance. Plugin multiplexing allows plugin processes to be
reused across all mounts of a given type.

## Plugin versioning

OpenBao supports managing, running and upgrading plugins using semantic version
information.

The plugin catalog optionally supports specifying a semantic version when
registering an external plugin. Multiple versions of a plugin can be registered
in the catalog simultaneously, and a version can be selected when mounting a
plugin or tuning an existing mount in-place.

If no version is specified when creating a new mount, the following precedence is used
for any available plugins whose type and name match:

* The plugin registered with no version
* The plugin with the most recent semantic version among any registered versions
* The plugin built into OpenBao

### Built-In versions

OpenBao will report a version for built-in plugins to indicate what version of the
plugin code got built into OpenBao as a dependency. For example:

```shell-session
$ bao plugin list secret
Name                Version
----                -------
kubernetes      v0.5.0+builtin
kv              v0.15.0+builtin
ldap            v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
openldap        v0.11.1+builtin
pki             v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
rabbitmq        v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
ssh             v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
totp            v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
transit         v1.14.8+builtin.openbao
```

Here, OpenBao has a dependency on `v0.15.0` of the [openbao-plugin-secrets-kv](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugin-secrets-kv)
repo, and the `openbao` metadata identifier for `pki` indicates that plugin's code was
within the OpenBao repo. For plugins within the OpenBao repo, OpenBao's own major, minor,
and patch versions are used to form the plugin version.

The `builtin` metadata identifier is reserved and cannot be used when registering
external plugins.
