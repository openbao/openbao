# OpenBao Support & Release EoL Policy

This policy was originally discussed [via email](https://lists.lfedge.org/g/OpenBao-TSC/topic/support_eol_policy_for/107532538)
and [approved by the OpenBao TSC](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/62586881/2024-10-10+OpenBao+TSC+Meeting)
on the October 10th, 2024 meeting.

## Proposal

A best effort by the maintainers and community will be made to identify and debug issues with releases. Any fixes identified will go into the next release. The latest release does not EoL, but users not on the latest release will be asked to test the latest release if the issue is not easily reproducible. Release timelines are roughly every month pending maintainer availability, at which point an evaluation will occur as to scope of the release (major, minor, or patch). Major and minor releases will be less frequent than every month and it may be several months between large releases.
