# OpenBao agent API proxy

OpenBao Agent's API Proxy functionality allows you to use OpenBao Agent's API as a proxy
for OpenBao's API.

:::warning

Note: This functionality will be deprecated in a future release. Please
switch to using [OpenBao Proxy](../proxy/index.mdx) for API proxying purposes, instead.

:::

## Functionality

The [`listener` stanza](index.mdx#listener-stanza) for OpenBao Agent configures a listener for OpenBao Agent. If
its `role` is not set to `metrics_only`, it will act as a proxy for the OpenBao server that
has been configured in the [`vault` stanza](index.mdx#vault-stanza) of OpenBao Agent. This enables access to the OpenBao
API from the Agent API, and can be configured to optionally allow or force the automatic use of
the Auto-Auth token for these requests, as described below.

If a `listener` has been configured alongside a `cache` stanza, the API Proxy will
first attempt to utilize the cache subsystem for qualifying requests, before forwarding the
request to OpenBao. See the [caching docs](caching/index.mdx) for more information on caching.

## Using Auto-Auth token

OpenBao Agent allows for easy authentication to OpenBao in a wide variety of
environments using [Auto-Auth](../autoauth/index.mdx). By setting the
`use_auto_auth_token` (see below) configuration, clients will not be required
to provide an OpenBao token to the requests made to the Agent. When this
configuration is set, if the request doesn't already bear a token, then the
auto-auth token will be used to forward the request to the OpenBao server. This
configuration will be overridden if the request already has a token attached,
in which case, the token present in the request will be used to forward the
request to the OpenBao server.

## Forcing Auto-Auth token

OpenBao Agent can be configured to force the use of the auto-auth token by using
the value `force` for the `use_auto_auth_token` option. This configuration
overrides the default behavior described above in [Using Auto-Auth
Token](apiproxy.mdx#using-auto-auth-token), and instead ignores any
existing OpenBao token in the request and instead uses the auto-auth token.


## Configuration (`api_proxy`)

The top level `api_proxy` block has the following configuration entries:

- `use_auto_auth_token` `(bool/string: false)` - If set, the requests made to Agent
without an OpenBao token will be forwarded to the OpenBao server with the
auto-auth token attached. If the requests already bear a token, this
configuration will be overridden and the token in the request will be used to
forward the request to the OpenBao server. If set to `"force"` Agent will use the
auto-auth token, overwriting the attached OpenBao token if set.

### Example configuration

Here is an example of a `listener` configuration alongside `api_proxy` configuration to force the use of the auto_auth token
and enforce consistency.

```hcl
# Other OpenBao agent configuration blocks
# ...

api_proxy {
  use_auto_auth_token = "force"
}

listener "tcp" {
    address = "127.0.0.1:8100"
    tls_disable = true
}
```
