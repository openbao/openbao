plugins for OpenBao.

## List pagination

When implementing listing, it is recommended to use pagination so that items are 
processed in increments rather than loading the entire set into memory at once. 
Learn more in [rfcs/paginated-lists](../rfcs/paginated-lists.mdx). 
`HandleListPage(...)` is a helper introduced in [PR #781](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/781) 
to streamline list pagination across implementations. It supports both item-level 
and batch-level callbacks for flexibility:

- **`itemCallback(...)`**: Processes individual entries within a page.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
    - `index` (int): The index of the entry within the current page.
    - `entry` (*logical.StorageEntry): The current storage entry being processed.
  - **Returns**:
    - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further entries.
    - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

- **`batchCallback(...)`**: Executes after processing all entries in a page.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `page` (int): The index of the current page.
    - `entries` ([]*logical.StorageEntry): All entries in the current batch.
  - **Returns**:
    - `cont` (bool): Whether to continue processing further pages.
    - `err` (error): An error, if encountered.

The callbacks are executed sequentially, with `itemCallback` processing each entry individually,
followed by `batchCallback` handling the entire batch.

## Listing Detailed Endpoints

Detailed listing of items is implemented using one of the following two methods:
- Supplying the `-detailed` CLI flag.
- Querying a `/detailed` API endpoint.

While both approaches are valid, it is recommended to implement a dedicated `/detailed` endpoint, as 
done in the `pki/certs/detailed` implementation ([PR #680](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/680)).

This has the following benefits:
- Avoids adding performance overhead on the default list endpoint. For example,
  in `pki/issuers`, the list API always returns both the list of `keys` and a
  `key_info` map containing metadata for each issuer. The `-detailed` flag
  simply controls whether this metadata is displayed in the CLI output.
- Restricts access to detailed listing by default unless an administrator has
  set up wildcards. For instance, when using `- detailed`, an admin who doesn't
  want users listing detailed information (because it is too resource intensive)
  would need to explicitly update their ACL policies to include
  `denied_parameters=detailed`.

## Revoke Operations Should Ignore "Not Found" Errors

If your secrets engine plugin implements a revoke operation for dynamic
credentials, it should consider a "credentials not found" error from the backing
system a successful revocation.

There are several reasons why credentials, that have already been revoked, will
be tried to be revoked by OpenBao:

- OpenBao was restored from a backup / snapshot
- OpenBao could not delete the lease from its storage after revoking the
  credentials (e.g. because it lost connection to PostgreSQL, a power outage or
  an OOM issue)
- The credentials were deleted externally (e.g. by an admin or some automated
  cleanup job)

Now, if your plugin returns an error when trying to revoke the non-existing
credentials, OpenBao will retry to revoke them forever (or until manual
intervention).

When implementing this logic, make sure you properly distinguish the
"credentials not found" (or "token not found" or "user not found") error from
other errors. For example, it might be problematic to simply match on the HTTP
404 status code, because that can have other reasons (like a reverse proxy
restarting). See the [Consul plugin revoke operation] for an example
implementation.

If you cannot safely detect the not found error, it is better to document this
as a known limitation and document how to manually recover from a revoke retry
loop (i.e. using the [`bao lease revoke`](../../commands/lease/revoke/) command
with the `-force` flag).
