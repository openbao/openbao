# audit

The `audit` command groups subcommands for interacting with OpenBao's audit
devices. Users can list, enable, and disable audit devices.

For more information, please see the [audit device
documentation](../../audit/index.mdx)

## Examples

Enable an audit device:

```shell-session
$ bao audit enable file file_path=/tmp/my-file.txt
Success! Enabled the file audit device at: file/
```

List all audit devices:

```shell-session
$ bao audit list
Path     Type    Description
----     ----    -----------
file/    file    n/a
```

Disable an audit device:

```shell-session
$ bao audit disable file/
Success! Disabled audit device (if it was enabled) at: file/
```

:::warning

Note: Once an audit device is disabled, you will no longer be able to HMAC values
for comparison with entries in the audit logs. This is true even if you re-enable
the audit device at the same path, as a new salt will be created for hashing.
