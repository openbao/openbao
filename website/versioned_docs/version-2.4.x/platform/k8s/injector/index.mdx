  OpenBao Agent containers to pods for consuming OpenBao secrets.

# Agent sidecar injector

The OpenBao Agent Injector alters pod specifications to include OpenBao Agent
containers that render OpenBao secrets to a shared memory volume using
[OpenBao Agent Templates](/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template).
By rendering secrets to a shared volume, containers within the pod can consume
OpenBao secrets without being OpenBao aware.

The injector is a [Kubernetes Mutation Webhook Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/).
The controller intercepts pod events and applies mutations to the pod if annotations exist within
the request. This functionality is provided by the [openbao-k8s](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-k8s)
project and can be automatically installed and configured using the
[OpenBao Helm](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-helm) chart.

## Overview

The OpenBao Agent Injector works by intercepting pod `CREATE` and `UPDATE`
events in Kubernetes. The controller parses the event and looks for the metadata
annotation `openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject: true`. If found, the controller will
alter the pod specification based on other annotations present.

### Mutations

At a minimum, every container in the pod will be configured to mount a shared
memory volume. This volume is mounted to `/openbao/secrets` and will be used by the OpenBao
Agent containers for sharing secrets with the other containers in the pod.

Next, two types of OpenBao Agent containers can be injected: init and sidecar. The
init container will prepopulate the shared memory volume with the requested
secrets prior to the other containers starting. The sidecar container will
continue to authenticate and render secrets to the same location as the pod runs.
Using annotations, the initialization and sidecar containers may be disabled.

Last, two additional types of volumes can be optionally mounted to the OpenBao Agent
containers. The first is secret volume containing TLS requirements such as client
and CA (certificate authority) certificates and keys. This volume is useful when
communicating and verifying the OpenBao server's authenticity using TLS. The second
is a configuration map containing OpenBao Agent configuration files. This volume is
useful to customize OpenBao Agent beyond what the provided annotations offer.

### Authenticating with OpenBao

The primary method of authentication with OpenBao when using the OpenBao Agent Injector
is the service account attached to the pod. Other authentication methods can be configured
using annotations.

For Kubernetes authentication, the service account must be bound to a OpenBao role and a
policy granting access to the secrets desired.

A service account must be present to use the OpenBao Agent Injector with the Kubernetes
authentication method. It is _not_ recommended to bind OpenBao roles to the default service
account provided to pods if no service account is defined.

### Requesting secrets

There are two methods of configuring the OpenBao Agent containers to render secrets:

- the `openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret` annotation, or
- a configuration map containing OpenBao Agent configuration files.

Only one of these methods may be used at any time.

#### Secrets via annotations

To configure secret injection using annotations, the user must supply:

- one or more _secret_ annotations, and
- the OpenBao role used to access those secrets.

The annotation must have the format:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-<unique-name>: /path/to/secret
```

The unique name will be the filename of the rendered secret and must be unique if
multiple secrets are defined by the user. For example, consider the following
secret annotations:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: database/roles/app
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-bar: consul/creds/app
openbao.openbao.com/role: 'app'
```

The first annotation will be rendered to `/openbao/secrets/foo` and the second
annotation will be rendered to `/openbao/secrets/bar`.

It's possible to set the file format of the rendered secret using the annotation. For example the
following secret will be rendered to `/openbao/secrets/foo.txt`:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-foo.txt: database/roles/app
openbao.openbao.com/role: 'app'
```

The secret unique name must consist of alphanumeric characters, `.`, `_` or `-`.

##### Secret templates

:::warning

OpenBao Agent uses the OpenBao Template project to render secrets. For more information
on writing templates, see the [OpenBao Template documentation](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-template).

:::

How the secret is rendered to the file is also configurable. To configure the template
used, the user must supply a _template_ annotation using the same unique name of
the secret. The annotation must have the following format:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-template-<unique-name>: |
  <
    TEMPLATE
    HERE
  >
```

For example, consider the following:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: 'database/creds/db-app'
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-template-foo: |
  {{- with secret "database/creds/db-app" -}}
  postgres://{{ .Data.username }}:{{ .Data.password }}@postgres:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable
  {{- end }}
openbao.openbao.com/role: 'app'
```

The rendered secret would look like this within the container:

```shell-session
$ cat /openbao/secrets/foo
postgres://v-kubernet-pg-app-q0Z7WPfVN:A1a-BUEuQR52oAqPrP1J@postgres:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable
```

:::warning

The default left and right template delimiters are `{{` and `}}`.

:::

If no template is provided the following generic template is used:

```
{{ with secret "/path/to/secret" }}
    {{ range $k, $v := .Data }}
        {{ $k }}: {{ $v }}
    {{ end }}
{{ end }}
```

For example, the following annotation will use the default template to render
PostgreSQL secrets found at the configured path:

```yaml
openbao.openbao.com/agent-inject-secret-foo: 'database/roles/pg-app'
openbao.openbao.com/role: 'app'
```

The rendered secret would look like this within the container:

```shell-session
$ cat /openbao/secrets/foo
password: A1a-BUEuQR52oAqPrP1J
username: v-kubernet-pg-app-q0Z7WPfVNqqTJuoDqCTY-1576529094
```

:::warning

Some secrets such as KV are stored in maps. Their data can be accessed using `.Data.data.<NAME>`

:::

### Renewals and updating secrets

For more information on when OpenBao Agent fetches and renews secrets, see the
[Agent documentation](/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#renewals-and-updating-secrets).

### OpenBao agent configuration map

For advanced use cases, it may be required to define OpenBao Agent configuration
files to mount instead of using secret and template annotations. The OpenBao Agent
Injector supports mounting ConfigMaps by specifying the name using the `openbao.openbao.com/agent-configmap`
annotation. The configuration files will be mounted to `/openbao/configs`.

The configuration map must contain either one or both of the following files:

- **config-init.hcl** used by the init container. This must have `exit_after_auth` set to `true`.
- **config.hcl** used by the sidecar container. This must have `exit_after_auth` set to `false`.

An example of mounting a OpenBao Agent configmap [can be found here](/docs/platform/k8s/injector/examples#configmap-example).
