```release-note:feature
**Transit**: Add support for key derivation mechansims (derives a new key from a base key).
   - This path uses the named base key and derivation algorithm specific parameters to derive a new named key.
   - Currently, only the ECDH key agreement algorithm is supported: the base key is one's own ECC private key and the "peer_public_key" is the pem-encoded other party's ECC public key.The computed shared secret is the resulting derived key.
