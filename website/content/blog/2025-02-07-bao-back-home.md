OpenBao returns from FOSDEM '25 and OpenUK's State of Open Con this week,
reflecting on the travels and activities of the events.

Many thanks to Fatima for running the [community calls](/docs/contributing/)
in our absence!

FOSDEM '25 was Alex's first time speaking at a conference and we are happy to
report it was a success! The details of the talk were saved and will be
published in a follow-up blog along with the recording when it is made
available from the conference. It was great to meet so many people interested
in identity and access management and OpenBao's role in solving secrets
management problems, at GitLab and beyond.

After arriving in London, BaoBao was happy to find the conference venue was
very well organized and everything was ready. And look, our logo is situated
nicely on the list of table holders! BaoBao thanks OpenUK for generously
sponsoring OpenBao's attendance this year and hopes to participate in the
future.

During setup, BaoBao took a place on the table to get ready for the next two
days of meeting people. When [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) couldn't make
it, Alex volunteered to represent them as well, which served as a great
conversation starter. BaoBao knows that they'd do the same, after all, we're
both OpenHashiForks!

After meeting the kind folks from [Percona](https://www.percona.com/) at
FOSDEM, we encountered them again at State of Open, where they played hijinks
with BaoBao! When Alex wandered off, they bestowed upon BaoBao a
[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) hat -- [a good reminder to revive and rename our
secrets engine](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/965)! BaoBao
appreciated the effort to avoid feeling chilly in the big conference center.

Later, [OSA Con](https://osacon.io) joined in the fun, placing a warning
sticker that this booth talked too much about open source... BaoBao thought
this disclaimer was much needed!

Finally, BaoBao and Alex got to meet [Dotan Horovits](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/horovits_stateofopencon-openbao-soocon25-activity-7292823212332085248-U4Bh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop),
the CNCF Ambassador who made the necessary connections to get OpenBao
invited to State of Open Con!

Both Alex and BaoBao had lots of fun networking and making friends
with fans of OpenBao. Thank you to everyone who organized these events and
helped them run so smoothly! A special thanks to all who offered to support
OpenBao or consider it for use in their company!
