# User lockout

If a user provides bad credentials several times in quick succession,
OpenBao will stop trying to validate their credentials for a while, instead returning immediately
with a permission denied error. We call this behavior "user lockout". The time for which
a user will be locked out is called “lockout duration”. The user will be able to login after the lockout
duration has passed. The number of failed login attempts after which the user is locked out is called
“lockout threshold”. The lockout threshold counter is reset to zero after a few minutes without login attempts,
or upon a successful login attempt. The duration after which the counter will be reset to zero
after no login attempts is called "lockout counter reset". This can defeat both automated and targeted requests
i.e, user-based password guessing attacks as well as automated attacks.

The user lockout feature is enabled by default. The default values for "lockout threshold" is 5 attempts,
"lockout duration" is 15 minutes, "lockout counter reset" is 15 minutes.

The user lockout feature can be disabled as follows:
- It can be disabled globally using environment variable `VAULT_DISABLE_USER_LOCKOUT`.
- It can be disabled for all supported auth methods (ldap, userpass and approle) or a specific supported auth method using the `disable_lockout`
  parameter within the `user_lockout` stanza in the configuration file.
  Please see [user lockout configuration](/docs/configuration/user-lockout#user_lockout-stanza) for more details.
- It can be disabled for a specific auth mount using "auth tune". Please see [auth tune command](/docs/commands/auth/tune)
  or [auth tune api](/api-docs/system/auth#tune-auth-method) for more details.

:::warning

**NOTE**: This feature is only supported by the userpass, ldap, and approle auth methods.

## Precedence

The precedence for user lockout configuration is as follows: 

Configuration for an auth mount using tune >> Configuration for an auth method in config file >> 
Configuration for "all" auth methods in config file >> Default values.

The precedence for user lockout disable is as follows: 

Disable using environment variable VAULT_DISABLE_USER_LOCKOUT >> 
Configuration for an auth mount using tune >> Configuration for an auth method in config file >> 
Configuration for "all" auth methods in config file >> Default values.

## Configuration

User lockout parameters can be configured using the config file for "all" auth methods or a specific auth method (userpass, ldap, or approle).
Please see [user lockout configuration](/docs/configuration/user-lockout#user_lockout-stanza) for more details. 

The user lockout configuration for the auth method at a given path can be tuned using auth tune. Please see [auth tune command](/docs/commands/auth/tune)
or [auth tune api](/api-docs/system/auth#tune-auth-method) for more details. 

## API 

Please see [sys/locked-users API](/api-docs/system/user-lockout) for more details.
