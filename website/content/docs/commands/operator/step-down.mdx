# operator step-down

The `operator step-down` forces the active OpenBao node within an [HA cluster](/vault/docs/concepts/ha)
to step down from active duty. When executed against a non-active node, i.e. a 
standby or [performance standby](/vault/docs/enterprise/performance-standby) node, 
the request will be forwarded to the active node.  While the 
affected node will have a delay before attempting to acquire 
the leader lock again, if no other OpenBao nodes acquire the
lock beforehand, it is possible for the same node to re-acquire
the lock and become active again.

## Examples

Force a OpenBao server to step down as the leader:

```shell-session
$ bao operator step-down
Success! Stepped down: http://127.0.0.1:8200
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.
