# `static` seal

The static key seal configures OpenBao to use static keys provided alongside
the configuration file as the Auto Unseal mechanism. These can either be provided
directly, in base64 or hex form, as an environment variable (using the `env://`
syntax), or as a file (using the `file://` syntax). This key must be a 32-bytes
for use as a AES-256-GCM-96 key. Other key algorithms are currently not
supported.

OpenBao's static key unseal support is activated by the following:

- The presence of a `seal "static"` block in OpenBao's configuration file.

:::warning

Carefully evaluate use of Static Key Auto Unseal to see if its use meets the
desired security properties. This mechanism is only recommended when an
existing source of trust, such as another third-party secrets manager, already
exists in the operating environment and it is desirable to chain OpenBao to
that secrets manager. It is imperative that any key material be injected
properly.

:::

## `static` example

This example shows configuring static seal through the OpenBao configuration
file by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "static" {
  current_key_id = "20250606-1"
  current_key = "file:///openbao/secrets/unseal-20250606-1.key"
  previous_key_id = "20250306-1"
  previous_key = "file:///openbao/secrets/unseal-20250306-1.key"
}
```

To create a sample key, use the `openssl rand` command:

```
$ openssl rand -out /openbao/secrets/unseal-20250606-1.key 32
```

## `static` parameters

These parameters apply to the `static` stanza in the OpenBao configuration
file:

- `current_key_id` `(string: <required>)`: permanent identifier of the key
  in the `current_key` field; whenever the final value of `current_key`
  changes (either directly or via modifying the referenced environment
  variable or file).

- `current_key` `(string: <required>)`: key to use for new seal operations;
  may have an `env://` or `file://` prefix to reference an environment
  variable or file respectively. Must be a 32-byte key to be used as an
  AES-256-GCM-96 key.

- `previous_key_id` `(string: <optional>)`: permanent identifier of the key
  in the `previous_key` field; whenever the final value of `previous_key`
  changes (either directly or via modifying the referenced environment
  variable or file). Must be present if `previous_key` is specified.

- `previous_key` `(string: <optional>)`: key to use for new seal operations;
  may have an `env://` or `file://` prefix to reference an environment
  variable or file respectively. Must be a 32-byte key to be used as an
  AES-256-GCM-96 key. Used for rotating seal keys; set `current_key` to the
  new key and `previous_key` to the value currently used to encrypt storage.

- `disabled` `(string: "")`: Set this to `true` if OpenBao is migrating from
  an auto seal configuration. Otherwise, set to `false`.

Refer to the [Seal Migration](/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration)
documentation for more information about the seal migration process.

## Key rotation

This mechanism supports `n-1` to `n` key rotation using the `previous_key` and
`current_key` fields, plus corresponding labels. Note that the key identifier
MUST always match the underlying key. It is suggested to use some scheme to
automatically compute this value from the underlying key.
