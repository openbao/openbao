# Resource quotas

Every single interaction with OpenBao, whether to put secrets into the key/value
store or to generate new pairs of database credentials for the MySQL database,
needs to go through OpenBaoâ€™s API.

One side effect of the API driven model is that applications and users can
misbehave by overwhelming system resources through consistent and high volume API
requests resulting in denial-of-service issues in some OpenBao nodes or even the
entire OpenBao cluster. This risk is significantly increased when OpenBao API endpoints
are exposed to thousands or millions of services deployed across a global infrastructure,
especially in use cases of OpenBao where OpenBao is deployed as a service for internal
developers.

OpenBao provides a feature, resource quotas, that allows OpenBao operators to specify
limits on resources used in OpenBao. Specifically, OpenBao allows operators to create
and configure API rate limits. 

## Rate limit quotas

OpenBao allows operators to create rate limit quotas which enforce API rate
limiting using a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm.
A rate limit quota can be created at the root level or defined on a namespace,
mount, or full API path by specifying a `path` when creating the quota. The rate
limiter is applied to each unique client IP address on a per-node basis (i.e. rate limit
quotas are not replicated). A client may invoke `rate` requests at any given second,
after which they may invoke additional requests at `rate` per-second.

A rate limit quota defined at the root level (i.e. empty `path`) is inherited by
all namespaces and mounts. It acts as a single rate limiter for the entire OpenBao
API. A rate limit quota defined on a namespace takes precedence over the global
rate limit quota, a rate limit quota defined for a mount takes precedence over
the global and namespace rate limit quotas, and a rate limit quota defined for
a specific path will take precedence over global, namespace, and mount quotas.
Additionally, quotas defined with a `role` to limit login requests made using
that role on the specified auth mount will take precedence over all other quotas.
In other words, the most specific quota rule will be applied.

A rate limit can be created with an optional `block_interval`, such that when set
to a non-zero value, any client that hits a rate limit threshold will be blocked
from all subsequent requests for a duration of `block_interval` seconds.

OpenBao also allows the inspection of the state of rate limiting in an OpenBao node
through various [metrics](/docs/internals/telemetry#Resource-Quota-Metrics) exposed
and through enabling optional audit logging.

## Exempt routes

By default, the following paths are exempt from rate limiting. However, OpenBao
operators can override the set of paths that are exempt from all rate limit
resource quotas by updating the `rate_limit_exempt_paths` configuration field.

- `sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt`
- `sys/generate-recovery-token/update`
- `sys/generate-root/attempt`
- `sys/generate-root/update`
- `sys/health`
- `sys/seal-status`
- `sys/unseal`

## API

Rate limit quotas can be managed over the HTTP API. Please see
[Rate Limit Quotas API](/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas) for more details.
