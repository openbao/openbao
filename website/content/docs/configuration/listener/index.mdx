# `listener` stanza

The `listener` stanza configures the addresses and ports on which OpenBao will
respond to requests. At this time, there are two listeners: 
- [TCP][tcp]
- [Unix Domain Socket][unix]

There is a [shared config][shared] that is common to all listeners.

[tcp]: tcp.mdx
[unix]: unix.mdx
[shared]: shared.mdx
