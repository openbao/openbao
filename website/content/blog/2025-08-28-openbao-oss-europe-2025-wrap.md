The OpenBao community had a great time at **[Open Source Summit Europe 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/)**! The event once again showed how strong the demand has become for secure and reliable secret management in enterprise environments.

One theme was clear: companies and individuals are in demand to manage secrets across their systems, and solutions like OpenBao are foundational for security and compliance.

Throughout the conference, we shared how OpenBao is able to help organizations to run production workloads securely. We showcased existing features such as strong encryption, fine-grained access controls and namespace isolation. We also gave a glimpse into whatâ€™s next: declarative initialization, improvements around namespaces and extended key management capabilties.

Furthermore, the conference was also a wonderful opportunity for OpenBao maintainers to meet in person, exchange ideas, and align on next steps. A big thank you goes to [**Adfinis**](https://adfinis.com/) and [**Reply**](https://www.reply.com/), who supported the project by sending maintainers to represent OpenBao on-site.

And finally, a heartfelt thanks to everyone who stopped by, joined discussions, or offered feedback. Your energy and curiosity keep the project moving forward. To everyone who was not able to join the conference, feel free to learn more at [**openbao.org**](https://openbao.org/) or join the conversation on [**Github**](https://github.com/openbao).
