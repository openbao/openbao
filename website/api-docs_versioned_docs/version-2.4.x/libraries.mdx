# Libraries

The programming libraries listed on this page can be used to consume the API more conveniently.
Some are officially maintained while others are provided by the community.

For a step-by-step walkthrough on using these client libraries, see the [developer quickstart](/docs/get-started/developer-qs).

:::warning

**Note**: OpenBao intends to remain API compatible with HashiCorp Vault. This
means that most of the existing [libraries for
Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/libraries) should also
work with OpenBao.

## Official
