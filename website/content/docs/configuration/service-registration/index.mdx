# `service_registration` stanza

The optional `service_registration` stanza configures OpenBao's mechanism for
service registration. The `service_registration` stanza is designed for use cases
where you would like to use a system like Kubernetes for service discovery, but use
a different system for the [storage backend][storage-backend].

For times when you would like to use a different storage backend, like
[Raft][raft-backend], but still have service registration available, the
`service_registration` stanza can be used:

```hcl
service_registration "kubernetes" {
  namespace      = "my-namespace"
  pod_name       = "my-pod-name"
}
storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "raft_node_1"
}
```

For information about a specific service registration provider, visit the
[Kubernetes Service Registration][kubernetes-service-registration] page.

## Configuration

Service registration configuration is done through the OpenBao configuration file
using the `service_registration` stanza:

```hcl
service_registration [NAME] {
  [PARAMETERS...]
}
```

For example:

```hcl
service_registration "kubernetes" {
  namespace      = "my-namespace"
  pod_name       = "my-pod-name"
}
```

For configuration options which also read an environment variable, the
environment variable will take precedence over values in the configuration
file.
