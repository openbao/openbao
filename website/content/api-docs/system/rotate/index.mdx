# `/sys/rotate`

### Encryption key rotation

The `/sys/rotate/keyring` endpoint is used to rotate the encryption key. It is
also possible to configure automatic encryption key rotation using
`/sys/rotate/keyring/config` endpoint.

### Rotate unseal/recovery keys

The `/sys/rotate/root` endpoints are used to rotate the root key for OpenBao,
and the unseal key shares when using Shamir's manual unseal mechanism.

On seals that support stored keys (e.g. HSM PKCS#11), the recovery key share(s)
can be provided to rotate the root key since no unseal keys are available. The
secret shares, secret threshold, and stored shares parameters must be set to 1.
Upon successful rotation, no split unseal key shares are returned.

The `/sys/rotate/recovery` endpoints are used to rotate the recovery keys for
OpenBao. These endpoints only apply to seals that support recovery keys.

Depending on the variable in the request path (`root` or `recovery`) 
operation is performed for the root or recovery keys.

### Progress rotation

`/sys/rotate/(root|recovery)/update` endpoint is used to enter a single
key share to progress the rotation of the OpenBao. If the threshold number
of key shares is reached, OpenBao will complete the rotation.

### Rotation verification
`/sys/rotate/(root|recovery)/verify` endpoint reads the configuration and
progress of the current rotation verification attempt.

### Backup rotated keys
`/sys/rotate/(root|recovery)/backup` endpoint returns the backup copy of
PGP-encrypted unseal keys. The returned value is the nonce of the rotate
operation and a map of PGP key fingerprint to hex-encoded PGP-encrypted key.
