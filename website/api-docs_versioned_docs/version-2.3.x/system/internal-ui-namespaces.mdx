# `/sys/internal/ui/namespaces`

The `/sys/internal/ui/namespaces` endpoint is used to expose namespaces
to the UI so that it can change its behavior in response, even before a user logs in.

This is currently only being used internally for the UI and is
an unauthenticated endpoint. Due to the nature of its intended usage, there is no
guarantee on backwards compatibility for this endpoint.

## Get namespaces

This endpoint lists the namespaces relevant to the UI.
