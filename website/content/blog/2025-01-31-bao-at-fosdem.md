From snowy Minnesota, [BaoBao](https://openbao.org/blog/fosdem-25/) took its
first ride to London Heathrow to begin its voyage to FOSDEM '25. With a brief
layover, it explored King's Cross and the Coal Drops Yard. Rich with history,
this area has long been used as a rail hub for the UK and now is connected to
Europe via the Channel Tunnel.

From there, BaoBao boarded a train to Paris, France for some sightseeing and
meetings with community members. BaoBao wishes that secrets management was as
easy as traveling via European trains, but, with the help of the community,
knows it will improve!

First up, the Eiffel Tower!

While it was rainy and dark, seeing the structure all lit up in person was
very impressive! BaoBao thought the structure loomed larger than life, just
like attackers in the shadows, targeting deployments using insecure secrets
management practices...

![BaoBao-Louvre](/img/baobao-fosdem-25-louvre.jpg)

The next day, BaoBao explored Paris a bit more, visiting the Notre Dame, the
Pantheon, and finally, the Louvre! One of the largest museums in the world,
filled with all types of art, from paintings to sculptures to fashion, this
museum would take several visits to fully appreciate. BaoBao thinks there's
art to open source too, and wishes it would be in its own museum some day!

BaoBao went out for dinner with its colleagues, Julien Cassignol (right),
OpenBao TSC representative and CTPO of Wallix, and Dan Ghita (left),
OpenBao Maintainer and backup Viaccess-Orca representative. BaoBao thinks
its favorite part of open source is the friends you make along the way.

On Friday, BaoBao took the train from Paris to Brussels to join the fun that
is FOSDEM. At dinner with friends old and new, BaoBao met Jan Martens, OpenBao
Maintainer.

And now, BaoBao rests for the conference ahead -- and hopes to see you there!
