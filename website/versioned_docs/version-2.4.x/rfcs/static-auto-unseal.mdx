# Automatic unseal using environment-provided keys

## Summary

Certain environments lack KMS or HSM systems but otherwise have a backing
secure secret store. This store would usually be used for KMS or HSM access
credentials and so relying on it for storing a static, auto-unseal key is of
equivalent security but much improved operational experience.

## Problem Statement

In certain provisioning processes, secret material must be carefully accounted
for. Deployment mechanisms may not have direct access to create new secrets;
instead, they are explicitly created ahead of time and referenced by the
provisioner. Some environments, such as Kubernetes, lack widely-deployed KMS or
HSM solutions (though, when available, should be preferred) but have secure
password or secret storage. Allowing auto-unseal with rotation with statically
injected secrets is of equivalent security and thus should be natively supported
as a fully-automated alternative to Shamir's or any roundabout approach with
PKCS#11 and SoftHSM. Thus, to some extent, this approach already exists in two
different forms, they are just _complex_ to operate.

In particular, usage of a KMS or HSM in this environment would usually result
in storing some connection information (such as certificate, token, or
password) in this platform secret store and thus would be equivalent to a
static but rotatable key as discussed more clearly in the [security
implications](#security-implications) section below.

## User-facing Description

This option is meant to be used when other alternatives are not available,
but a trusted base platform exists and a fully auto-unseal-able solution
is required.

OpenBao would support a new auto-unseal mechanism, `static`, as follows:

```hcl
seal "static" {
    previous_key = "file:///volumes/secrets/last-unseal-key"
    previous_key_id = "33c9886e-7c93-4252-bf7c-8b15f4fd937c"
    current_key = "file:///volumes/secrets/current-unseal-key"
    current_key_id = "0c94ff77-42b6-4de2-b27a-8f7c166fb162"
}
```

This will [use](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping/blob/1a1c5b0c79b112d9d08dadc53b4d98c7e5166397/options.go#L159-L181)
`go-kms-wrapping`'s existing [`parseutil.ParsePath`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-secure-stdlib/parseutil#ParsePath)
helpers, allowing the use of keys from either the environment (`env://`) or
the filesystem (`file://`), in addition to literal explicit keys in raw,
hex, or base64 encodings.

The key identifiers (`previous_key_id` and `current_key_id`) must
remain the same through the lifecycle of the corresponding key.

Because key identifiers cannot be changed (as they are part of the
configuration), keys are loaded in memory at startup and are not reloaded
on SIGHUP currently. When [Parallel Unseal](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/1021)
lands, this could allow keys to be reloaded without requiring restarting
the server.

This does not change auto-unseal initialization processes; `/sys/init` will
still need to be called and will return the same information.

## Technical Description

After loading the last and current keys, these keys will be validated to be
AES-256 keys. The seal mechanism will only support AES-256 GCM-96, matching
the barrier encryption algorithm at this time.

In the future, additional encryption algorithms _may_ be supported but the
default will remain.

This choice of algorithm is both performant and secure for our use case.

This unseal mechanism behaves like existing unseal mechanisms and will be
implemented in [`go-kms-wrapping`](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping).
It **will not** directly [write `root` keys](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/1021),
and these will function as the parent auto-unseal device's keys, encrypting
OpenBao's root key.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Two alternatives exist:

1. Projects which automate manual unseal using Shamir's, like
   [lrstanley/vault-unseal](https://github.com/lrstanley/vault-unseal) or
   [quickvm/vault-unseal](https://github.com/quickvm/vault-unseal),
   demonstrate the need for this type of solution and the propensity to
   work around it. This type of mechanism is also used in
   [bank-vaults](https://bank-vaults.dev/docs/concepts/unseal-keys/)
   to solve the shortcomings there.
2. For fully pre-configured key usage, one could script this today by
   loading SoftHSMv2 alongside OpenBao and choose the PKCS#11 auto-unseal
   mechanism. The executor could take the key material from the environment,
   place it into a fresh SoftHSMv2 token, and write the dynamic portion of
   the PKCS#11 HSM configuration prior to starting the OpenBao service.

Combined, this demonstrates both need and viability of workarounds, justifying
the simplicity.

## Downsides

The biggest downside of this approach is that it becomes more widely
available: rather than a complex dance with PKCS#11 and SoftHSM, the risk
is that this becomes a default option for users rather than a more dynamic
alternative.

However, given the operational simplicity of this over the SoftHSM solution,
the benefits likely outweigh this downside.

## Security Implications

Precisely, the security delta becomes revocation and rotation of that key:
while credentials injected into a secret store are theoretically revokable,
a static encryption key is not. In practice, without seal wrapping, an
attacker would only need a single successful decryption attempt of the root
key with these exfiltrated credentials to reach an equivalent state. At that
point any compromise of storage would result in equivalent loss of data
confidentiality. All stored secrets would thus be equivalently rotated or
re-established and operator recovery procedures would be the same between
both implementations.

If the host itself is not compromised, there may be an additional mitigation
that KMSes and HSMs may be able to perform IP filtering, use a host-local
communication method like PCIe, or other defensive mechanisms against
exfiltration of credentials. If the platform itself is compromised in such a
way that the secret store is compromised, an attacker _may_ have gotten
sufficiently privileged credentials to also be able to pivot onto the
OpenBao machine.

On the whole, in most environments, it is expected that KMSs and HSMs are
the preferred choice for auto-unseal.

Using this auto-unseal method thus requires careful review of your
operational environment to detail threat models and to assess the security
of this mechanism.

## User/Developer Experience

Operators running on platforms with a pre-existing secret store and without
KMS or HSM solutions will be able to define, ahead of OpenBao initialization,
a static key with which to encrypt the root key. This key could be rotated
as desired, assuming the current key is also still available. As long as these
keys remain secure, storage will remain secure.
