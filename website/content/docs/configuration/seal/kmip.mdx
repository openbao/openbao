# `kmip` seal

The KMIP seal configures OpenBao to use a KMS or an HSM through the KMIP protocol as the autounseal
mechanism. OpenBao's KMIP support is activated by one of the following:

- The presence of a `seal "kmip"` block in OpenBao's configuration file
- The presence of the environment variable `BAO_SEAL_TYPE` set to `kmip`. If enabling via environment
  variable, all other required values (i.e. `BAO_KMIP_ENDPOINT`) must be also
  supplied.

:::info

OpenBao requires key material to be created externally
before initializing the instance. OpenBao will not attempt to create its own
key material.

:::

:::warning

Because KMIP auto-unseal was not present in Vault v1.14 OSS, it is not
expected that it is [seal-compatible](/docs/policies/migration/); manual
migration of data between nodes may be required.

:::

## KMIP Server Requirements

- Must support one of the following KMIP protocol version: v1.2, v1.3 or v1.4.
- Must support Encrypt & Decrypt operations
- Must support AES symmetric keys or RSA key pairs
- Must support one of the following encryption algorithms
  - AES_GCM
  - RSA_OAEP_SHA256
  - RSA_OAEP_SHA384
  - RSA_OAEP_SHA512

## `kmip` example

This example shows configuring KMIP seal through the OpenBao configuration
file by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "kmip" {
  endpoint = "eu-west-rbx.okms.ovh.net:5696"
  kms_key_id = "c1afd090-e8ae-4d03-a81f-3938b7e2be02"
  client_cert = "client-cert.pem"
  client_key = "client-key.pem"

  // Optional parameters:
  //
  // ca_cert = ""
  // server_name = ""
  // timeout = 10
  // encrypt_alg = ""
  // tls12_ciphers = ""
}
```

To create the key in the KMIP Server, it is recommended to use your KMIP server vendor tooling.
The created key, or key-pair must be set into the `active` state.

Example for creating a KMIP key on OVHcloud's KMS offer using the [okms command line tool](https://github.com/ovh/okms-cli):

```bash
$ okms kmip create symmetric --alg AES --size 256 --usage encrypt,decrypt --name bao_seal_key
$ okms kmip activate "<KEY-ID>"
```
or
```bash
$ okms kmip create key-pair --alg RSA --size 4096 --private-usage decrypt --public-usage encrypt --private-name bao_seal_key_private --public-name bao_seal_key_public
$ okms kmip activate "<PRIVATE-KEY-ID>"
$ okms kmip activate "<PUBLIC-KEY-ID>"
```

:::info

[okms command line tool](https://github.com/ovh/okms-cli) kmip subcommands directly uses the KMIP protocol and should work with any KMIP server.

:::

Alternatively you can use libraries like [PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP) or [kmip-go](https://github.com/ovh/kmip-go).

## `kmip` parameters

These parameters apply to the `seal` stanza in the OpenBao configuration file:

- `kms_key_id` `(string: <required>)`: The wrapping key ID. Must be a symmetric AES key or a private RSA key).
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_WRAPPER_KEY_ID` environment variable.

- `endpoint` `(string: <required>)`: The KMIP endpoitn address and port. For example `my-kms.example.org:5696`.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

- `client_cert` `(string: <required>)`: The client authentication TLS certificate.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable.

- `client_key` `(string: <required>)`: The client TLS private key.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable.

- `ca_cert` `(string: "")`: The server CA certificate.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_CA_CERT` environment variable.

- `server_name` `(string: "")`: Optional server name,
  used to verify the hostname on the returned certificates.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_SERVER_NAME`
  environment variable.

- `timeout` `(integer: 10)`: KMIP operation timeout in seconds.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

- `encrypt_alg` `(string: "AES_GCM")`: The encryption/decryption algorithm to use.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_ENCRYPT_ALG` environment variable.

  Currently supported algorithms:
  - `AES_GCM`
  - `RSA_OAEP_SHA256`
  - `RSA_OAEP_SHA384`
  - `RSA_OAEP_SHA512`

- `tls12_ciphers` `(string: "")`: Comma separated list of TLS 1.2 ciphers to allow.
  Use golang's default list as default allowed ciphers.
  May also be specified by the `BAO_KMIP_TLS12_CIPHERS` environment variable.

- `disabled` `(string: "")`: Set this to `true` if OpenBao is migrating from an auto seal configuration. Otherwise, set to `false`.

Refer to the [Seal Migration](/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) documentation for more information about the seal migration process.
  
## `kmip` environment variables

Alternatively, the KMIP seal can be activated and configured by providing the following
environment variables:

```text
BAO_SEAL_TYPE
BAO_KMIP_WRAPPER_KEY_ID
BAO_KMIP_ENDPOINT
BAO_KMIP_CA_CERT
BAO_KMIP_CLIENT_CERT
BAO_KMIP_CLIENT_KEY
BAO_KMIP_SERVER_NAME
BAO_KMIP_TIMEOUT
BAO_KMIP_ENCRYPT_ALG
BAO_KMIP_TLS12_CIPHERS
```

## Key rotation

This seal supports rotating keys by using different key IDs to track key versions. To rotate
the key value, create a new key or perform a rotation in the KMIP server and update OpenBao's
configuration with the new key ID. 
The key type and encryption algorithm can also be changed as OpenBao keeps track of the algorithm.
Restart your OpenBao instance to pick up the new keyID and all new encryption operations will use 
the updated key and algorithm. Old keys must not be disabled or deleted and are used to decrypt older data.

## Interoperability
While it's expected to work on most KMIP servers complying to the requirements stated above,
the KMIP seal has only been tested and validated against following implementations:
- [PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP) with following restrictions:
    - Only `AES_GCM` is supported as PyKMIP does not implement asymmetric encryption.
    - TLS 1.2 cipher `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256` had to be allowed in wrapper config.
- [OVHcloud's KMS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/identity-security-operations/key-management-service/)
