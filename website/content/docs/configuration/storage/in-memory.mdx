# In-Memory storage backend

The In-Memory storage backend is used to persist OpenBao's data entirely in-memory
on the same machine in which OpenBao is running. This is useful for development
and experimentation, but use of this backend is **highly discouraged in
production**. All data is lost when OpenBao or the machine on which it is running
is restarted.


:::warning

**No High Availability** – the In-Memory backend does not support high
  availability. Only a single OpenBao node may use this storage.

:::

:::danger

**Not Production Recommended** – the In-Memory backend is not recommended for
production installations as data does not persist beyond restarts.

:::

```hcl
storage "inmem" {}
```

## `inmem` parameters

The In-Memory storage backend has no configuration parameters.

## `inmem` examples

This example shows activating the In-Memory storage backend.

```hcl
storage "inmem" {}
```
