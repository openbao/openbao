```release-note:feature
cli: add new subcommand "bao operator validate-config" to validate a config.
It is similar to "bao operator diagnose", but it only validates the config and not the system it is running on (e.g. it will not check that the raft directory is writable).
This allows it to be used on an operators Laptop or in CI validations.
```
