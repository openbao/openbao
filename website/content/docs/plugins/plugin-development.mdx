# Plugin development

:::warning

Advanced topic! Plugin development is a highly advanced topic in OpenBao, and
is not required knowledge for day-to-day usage. If you don't plan on writing any
plugins, we recommend not reading this section of the documentation.

:::

Because OpenBao communicates to plugins over a RPC interface, you can build and
distribute a plugin for OpenBao without having to rebuild OpenBao itself. This makes
it easy for you to build an OpenBao plugin for your organization's internal use,
for a proprietary API that you don't want to open source, or to prototype
something before contributing it back to the main project.

In theory, because the plugin interface is HTTP, you could even develop a plugin
using a completely different programming language! (Disclaimer, you would also
have to re-implement the plugin API which is not a trivial amount of work.)

Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write
a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the
[Go programming language](http://golang.org).

Your plugin implementation needs to satisfy the interface for the plugin
type you want to build. You can find these definitions in the docs for the
backend running the plugin.

:::warning

Note: Plugins should be prepared to handle multiple concurrent requests
from OpenBao.

## Serving a plugin

### Serving a plugin with multiplexing

:::warning

Plugin multiplexing requires `github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk v0.5.4` or above.

:::

The following code exhibits an example main package for an OpenBao plugin using
the OpenBao SDK for a secrets engine or auth method:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	myPlugin "your/plugin/import/path"
	"github.com/openbao/openbao/api/v2"
	"github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk/v2/plugin"
)

func main() {
	apiClientMeta := &api.PluginAPIClientMeta{}
	flags := apiClientMeta.FlagSet()
	flags.Parse(os.Args[1:])

	tlsConfig := apiClientMeta.GetTLSConfig()
	tlsProviderFunc := api.VaultPluginTLSProvider(tlsConfig)

	err := plugin.ServeMultiplex(&plugin.ServeOpts{
		BackendFactoryFunc: myPlugin.Factory,
		TLSProviderFunc:    tlsProviderFunc,
	})
	if err != nil {
		logger := hclog.New(&hclog.LoggerOptions{})

		logger.Error("plugin shutting down", "error", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

And that's basically it! You would just need to change `myPlugin` to your actual
plugin.

## Plugin backwards compatibility with OpenBao

Let's take a closer look at a snippet from the above main package.

```go
	err := plugin.ServeMultiplex(&plugin.ServeOpts{
		BackendFactoryFunc: myPlugin.Factory,
		TLSProviderFunc:    tlsProviderFunc,
	})
```

The call to `plugin.ServeMultiplex` ensures that the plugin will use
OpenBao's [plugin
multiplexing](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-multiplexing) feature.
However, this plugin will not be multiplexed if it is run by a version of OpenBao
that does not support multiplexing. OpenBao will simply fall back to a plugin
version that it can run. Additionally, we set the `TLSProviderFunc` to ensure
that our plugin is backwards compatible with versions of OpenBao that do not
support automatic mutual TLS for secure [plugin
communication](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-communication). If you
are certain your plugin does not need backwards compatibility, this field can
be omitted.

## Leveraging plugin versioning

@include 'plugin-versioning.mdx'

Auth and secrets plugins based on `framework.Backend` from the SDK should set the
[`RunningVersion`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/sdk/v0.6.0/sdk/framework/backend.go#L95-L96)
variable, and the framework will implement the version interface.

Database plugins have a smaller API than `framework.Backend` exposes, and should
instead implement the
[`PluginVersioner`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/sdk/v0.6.0/sdk/logical/logical.go#L150-L154)
interface directly.

## Building a plugin from source

To build a plugin from source, first navigate to the location holding the
desired plugin version. Next, run `go build` to obtain a new binary for the
plugin. Finally,
[register](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-registration) the
plugin and enable it.
