# `storage` stanza

The `storage` stanza configures the storage backend, which represents the
location for the durable storage of OpenBao's information. Each backend has pros,
cons, advantages, and trade-offs. For example, some backends support high
availability while others provide a more robust backup and restoration process.
For information about a specific backend, choose one from the navigation on the
left.

## Configuration

Storage backend configuration is done through the OpenBao configuration file using
the `storage` stanza:

```hcl
storage [NAME] {
  [PARAMETERS...]
}
```

For example:

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path = "/mnt/openbao/raft"
}
```

For configuration options which also read an environment variable, the
environment variable will take precedence over values in the configuration
file.

## Integrated Storage (Raft) vs. PostgreSQL

It is recommended to use OpenBao's [integrated storage](/docs/configuration/storage/raft)
for most use cases rather than configuring another system to store OpenBao
data externally. (Integrated Storage is an **embedded OpenBao data storage**
writing to the file system).

The table below compares the characteristics of Integrated Storage and PostgreSQL.

|                                | Integrated Storage                                                                                                   | PostgreSQL                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Production Ready               | Yes                                                                                                                  | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Operation                      | Operationally simpler with no additional software installation required.                                             | Must install and configure the external storage environment outside of OpenBao. For high availability, the external storage should be clustered.                                                                                        |
| Networking                     | One less network hop: data is stored locally resulting in higher read performance.                                   | Extra network hop between OpenBao and the external storage system if not co-located.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Troubleshooting and monitoring | Integrated Storage is a part of OpenBao; therefore, OpenBao is the only system you need to monitor and troubleshoot. | The source of failure could be the external storage; therefore, you need to check the health of both OpenBao and the external storage. This requires expertise in the chosen storage backend and additional monitoring of that storage. |
| Data location                  | The encrypted OpenBao data is stored on the same host where the OpenBao server process runs.                         | The encrypted OpenBao data is stored where the external storage is located. Therefore, the OpenBao server and the data storage are hosted on physically separate hosts.                                                                 |
| System requirements            | Avoid "burstable" CPU and storage options. SSDs should be used for the hard drive.                                   | Follow the system requirements given by your chosen storage backend.                                                                                                                                                                    |
