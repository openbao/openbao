# PKI secrets engine - considerations

To successfully deploy this secrets engine, there are a number of important
considerations to be aware of, as well as some preparatory steps that should be
undertaken. You should read all of these _before_ using this secrets engine or
generating the CA to use with this secrets engine.

## Be careful with root CAs

OpenBao storage is secure, but not as secure as a piece of paper in a bank vault.
It is, after all, networked software. If your root CA is hosted outside of
OpenBao, don't put it in OpenBao as well; instead, issue a shorter-lived
intermediate CA certificate and put this into OpenBao. This aligns with industry
best practices.

Since 0.4, the secrets engine supports generating self-signed root CAs and
creating and signing CSRs for intermediate CAs. In each instance, for security
reasons, the private key can _only_ be exported at generation time, and the
ability to do so is part of the command path (so it can be put into ACL
policies).

If you plan on using intermediate CAs with OpenBao, it is suggested that you let
OpenBao create CSRs and do not export the private key, then sign those with your
root CA (which may be a second mount of the `pki` secrets engine).

## One CA certificate, one secrets engine

The PKI Secrets Engine supports multiple issuers in a single mount. However, in
order to simplify the configuration, it is _strongly_ recommended that operators
limit a mount to a single issuer. If you want to issue certificates from
multiple disparate CAs, mount the PKI secrets engine at multiple mount points
with separate CA certificates in each.

The rationale for separating mounts is to simplify permissions management:
very few individuals need access to perform operations with the root, but
many need access to create leaves. The operations on a root should generally
be limited to issuing and revoking intermediate CAs, which is a highly
privileged operation; it becomes much easier to audit these operations when
they're in a separate mount than if they're mixed in with day-to-day leaf
issuance.

A common pattern is to have one mount act as your root CA and to use this CA
only to sign intermediate CA CSRs from other PKI secrets engines.

To keep old CAs active, there's two approaches to achieving rotation:

 1. Use multiple secrets engines. This allows a fresh start, preserving the
    old issuer and CRL. OpenBao ACL policy can be updated to deny new issuance
    under the old mount point and roles can be re-evaluated before being
    imported into the new mount point.
 2. Use multiple issuers in the same mount point. The usage of the old issuer
    can be restricted to CRL signing, and existing roles and ACL policy can be
    kept as-is. This allows cross-signing within the same mount, and consumers
    of the mount won't have to update their configuration. Once the transitional
    period for this rotation has completed and all past issued certificate have
    expired, it is encouraged to fully remove the old issuer and any unnecessary
    cross-signed issuers from the mount point.

Another suggested use case for multiple issuers in the same mount is splitting
issuance by TTL lifetime. For short-lived certificates, an intermediate
stored in OpenBao will often out-perform a HSM-backed intermediate. For
longer-lived certificates, however, it is often important to have the
intermediate key material secured throughout the lifetime of the end-entity
certificate. This means that two intermediates in the same mount -- one backed
by the HSM and one backed by OpenBao -- can satisfy both use cases. Operators
can make roles setting maximum TTLs for each issuer and consumers of the
mount can decide which to use.

### Always configure a default issuer

For backwards compatibility, [the default issuer](/api-docs/secret/pki#read-issuers-configuration)
is used to service PKI endpoints without an explicit issuer (either via path
selection or role-based selection). When certificates are revoked and their
issuer is no longer part of this PKI mount, OpenBao places them on the default
issuer's CRL. This means maintaining a default issuer is important for both
backwards compatibility for issuing certificates and for ensuring revoked
certificates land on a CRL.

## Key types matter

Certain key types have impacts on performance. Signing certificates from a RSA
key will be slower than issuing from an ECDSA or Ed25519 key. Key generation
(using `/issue/:role` endpoints) using RSA keys will also be slow: RSA key
generation involves finding suitable random primes, whereas Ed25519 keys can
be random data. As the number of bits goes up (RSA 2048 -> 4096 or ECDSA
P-256 -> P-521), signature times also increases.

This matters in both directions: not only is issuance more expensive,
but validation of the corresponding signature (in say, TLS handshakes) will
also be more expensive. Careful consideration of both issuer and issued key
types can have meaningful impacts on performance of not only OpenBao, but
systems using these certificates.

### Cluster performance and key type

The [benchmark-vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-benchmark) project
can be used to measure the performance of an OpenBao PKI instance. In general,
some considerations to be aware of:

 - RSA key generation is much slower and highly variable than EC key
   generation. If performance and throughput are a necessity, consider using
   EC keys (including NIST P-curves and Ed25519) instead of RSA.

 - Key signing requests (via `/pki/sign`) will be faster than (`/pki/issue`),
   especially for RSA keys: this removes the necessity for OpenBao to generate
   key material and can sign the key material provided by the client. This
   signing step is common between both endpoints, so key generation is pure
   overhead if the client has a sufficiently secure source of entropy.

 - The CA's key type matters as well: using a RSA CA will result in a RSA
   signature and takes longer than a ECDSA or Ed25519 CA.

 - Storage is an important factor: with [BYOC Revocation](/api-docs/secret/pki#revoke-certificate),
   using `no_store=true` still gives you the ability to revoke certificates
   and audit logs can be used to track issuance. Clusters using a remote
   storage over a slow network and using `no_store=false` will
   result in additional latency on issuance. Adding leases for every issued
   certificate compounds the problem.

    - Storing too many certificates results in longer `LIST /pki/certs` time,
      including the time to tidy the instance. As such, for large scale
      deployments (>= 250k active certificates) it is recommended to use audit
      logs to track certificates outside of OpenBao.

As a general comparison on unspecified hardware, using `benchmark-vault` for
`30s` on a local, single node, raft-backed OpenBao instance:

  - OpenBao can issue 300k certificates using EC P-256 for CA & leaf keys and
    without storage.

    - But switching to storing these leaves drops that number to 65k, and only
      20k with leases.

 - Using large, expensive RSA-4096 bit keys, OpenBao can only issue 160 leaves,
   regardless of whether or not storage or leases were used. The 95% key
   generation time is above 10s.

    - In comparison, using P-521 keys, OpenBao can issue closer to 30k leaves
      without leases and 18k with leases.

These numbers are for example only, to represent the impact different key types
can have on PKI cluster performance.

The use of ACME adds additional latency into these numbers, both because
certificates need to be stored and because challenge validation needs to
be performed.

## Use a CA hierarchy

It is generally recommended to use a hierarchical CA setup, with a root
certificate which issues one or more intermediates (based on usage), which
in turn issue the leaf certificates.

This allows stronger storage or policy guarantees around [protection of the
root CA](#be-careful-with-root-cas), while letting OpenBao manage the
intermediate CAs and issuance of leaves. Different intermediates might be
issued for different usage, such as VPN signing, Email signing, or testing
versus production TLS services. This helps to keep CRLs limited to specific
purposes: for example, VPN services don't care about the revoked set of
email signing certificates if they're using separate certificates and
different intermediates, and thus don't need both CRL contents. Additionally,
this allows higher risk intermediates (such as those issuing longer-lived
email signing certificates) to have HSM-backing without impacting the
performance of easier-to-rotate intermediates and certificates (such as
TLS intermediates).

OpenBao supports the use of both the [`allowed_domains` parameter on
Roles](/api-docs/secret/pki#allowed_domains) and the [`permitted_dns_domains`
parameter to set the Name Constraints extension](/api-docs/secret/pki#permitted_dns_domains)
on root and intermediate generation. This allows for several layers of
separation of concerns between TLS-based services.

### Cross-Signed intermediates

When cross-signing intermediates from two separate roots, two separate
intermediate issuers will exist within the OpenBao PKI mount. In order to
correctly serve the cross-signed chain on issuance requests, the
`manual_chain` override is required on either or both intermediates. This
can be constructed in the following order:

 - this issuer (`self`)
 - this root
 - the other copy of this intermediate
 - the other root

All requests to this issuer for signing will now present the full cross-signed
chain.

## Cluster URLs are important

ACME support uses the same configuration as [templated AIA
URLs](/api-docs/secret/pki#enable_aia_url_templating-1)to allow ACME
clients to discover the URL of this cluster.

:::warning

**Warning**: It is important to ensure that this configuration is
   up to date and maintained correctly, always pointing to the node's cluster
   address (which may be a Load Balanced or a DNS Round-Robbin address). If this
   configuration is not set on every node, certificate issuance (via REST and/or
   via ACME) will fail.

:::

## Automate rotation with ACME

The PKI Engine supports the [Automatic Certificate Management Environment
(ACME)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) protocol. This is a
standardized way to handle validation, issuance, rotation, and revocation of
server certificates.

Many ecosystems, from web servers like Caddy, Nginx, and Apache, to
orchestration environments like Kubernetes (via cert-manager) natively
support issuance via the ACME protocol. For deployments without native
support, stand-alone tools like certbot support fetching and renewing
certificates on behalf of consumers. OpenBao's PKI Engine only includes server
support for ACME; no client functionality has been included.

:::warning

Note: OpenBao's PKI ACME server caps the certificate's validity at 90 days
   maximum, regardless of role and/or global limits. Shorter validity
   durations can be set via limiting the role's TTL to be under 90 days.
   Aligning with Let's Encrypt, we do not support the optional `NotBefore`
   and `NotAfter` order request parameters.

:::

### ACME stores certificates

Because ACME requires stored certificates in order to function, the notes
[below about automating tidy](#automate-crl-building-and-tidying) are
especially important for the long-term health of the PKI cluster. ACME also
introduces additional resource types (accounts, orders, authorizations, and
challenges) that must be tidied via [the `tidy_acme=true`
option](/api-docs/secret/pki#tidy). Orders, authorizations, and
challenges are [cleaned up based on the
`safety_buffer`](/api-docs/secret/pki#safety_buffer)
parameter, but accounts can live longer past their last issued certificate
by controlling the [`acme_account_safety_buffer`
parameter](/api-docs/secret/pki#acme_account_safety_buffer).

As a consequence of the above, and like the discussions in the [Cluster
Scalability](#cluster-scalability) section, because these roles have
`no_store=false` set, ACME can only issue certificates on the active nodes
of PR clusters; standby nodes, if contacted, will transparently forward
all requests to the active node.

### ACME role restrictions require EAB

Because ACME by default has no external authorization engine and is
unauthenticated from an OpenBao perspective, the use of roles with ACME
in the default configuration are of limited value as any ACME client
can request certificates under any role by proving possession of the
requested certificate identifiers.

To solve this issue, there are two possible approaches:

 1. Use a restrictive [`allowed_roles`, `allowed_issuers`, and
    `default_directory_policy` ACME
    configuration](/api-docs/secret/pki#set-acme-configuration)
    to let only a single role and issuer be used. This prevents user
    choice, allowing some global restrictions to be placed on issuance
    and avoids requiring ACME clients to have (at initial setup) access
    to an OpenBao token other mechanism for acquiring an OpenBao EAB ACME token.
 2. Use a more permissive [configuration with
    `eab_policy=always-required`](/api-docs/secret/pki#eab_policy)
    to allow more roles and users to select the roles, but bind ACME clients
    to an OpenBao token which can be suitably ACL'd to particular sets of
    approved ACME directories.

The choice of approach depends on the policies of the organization wishing
to use ACME.

Another consequence of the OpenBao unauthenticated nature of ACME requests
are that role templating, based on entity information, cannot be used as
there is no token and thus no entity associated with the request, even when
EAB binding is used.

### ACME and the public internet

Using ACME is possible over the public internet; public CAs like Let's Encrypt
offer this as a service. Similarly, organizations running internal PKI
infrastructure might wish to issue server certificates to pieces of
infrastructure outside of their internal network boundaries, from a publicly
accessible OpenBao instance. By default, without enforcing a restrictive
`eab_policy`, this results in a complicated threat model: _any_ external
client which can prove possession of a domain can issue a certificate under
this CA, which might be considered more trusted by this organization.

As such, we strongly recommend publicly facing OpenBao instances enforce that
PKI mount operators have required a [restrictive `eab_policy=always-required`
configuration](/api-docs/secret/pki#eab_policy).  System administrators of
OpenBao instances can enforce this by [setting the
`VAULT_DISABLE_PUBLIC_ACME=true` environment
variable](/api-docs/secret/pki#acme-external-account-bindings).

### ACME errors are in server logs

Because the ACME client is not necessarily trusted (as account registration
may not be tied to a valid OpenBao token when EAB is not used), many error
messages end up in the OpenBao server logs out of security necessity. When
troubleshooting issues with clients requesting certificates, first check
the client's logs, if any, (e.g., certbot will state the log location on
errors), and then correlate with OpenBao server logs to identify the failure
reason.

### ACME security considerations

ACME allows any client to use OpenBao to make some sort of external call;
while the design of ACME attempts to minimize this scope and will prohibit
issuance if incorrect servers are contacted, it cannot account for all
possible remote server implementations. OpenBao's ACME server makes three
types of requests:

 1. DNS requests for `_acme-challenge.<domain>`, which should be least
    invasive and most safe.
 2. TLS ALPN requests for the `acme-tls/1` protocol, which should be
    safely handled by the TLS before any application code is invoked.
 3. HTTP requests to `http://<domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>`,
    which could be problematic based on server design; if all requests,
    regardless of path, are treated the same and assumed to be trusted,
    this could result in OpenBao being used to make (invalid) requests.
    Ideally, any such server implementations should be updated to ignore
    such ACME validation requests or to block access originating from OpenBao
    to this service.

In all cases, no information about the response presented by the remote
server is returned to the ACME client.

When running OpenBao on multiple networks, note that OpenBao's ACME server
places no restrictions on requesting client/destination identifier
validations paths; a client could use a HTTP challenge to force OpenBao to
reach out to a server on a network it could otherwise not access.

## Keep certificate lifetimes short, for CRL's sake

This secrets engine aligns with OpenBao's philosophy of short-lived secrets. As
such it is not expected that CRLs will grow large; the only place a private key
is ever returned is to the requesting client (this secrets engine does _not_
store generated private keys, except for CA certificates). In most cases, if the
key is lost, the certificate can simply be ignored, as it will expire shortly.

If a certificate must truly be revoked, the normal OpenBao revocation function can
be used, and any revocation action will cause the CRL to be regenerated. When
the CRL is regenerated, any expired certificates are removed from the CRL (and
any revoked, expired certificate are removed from secrets engine storage). This
is an expensive operation! Due to the structure of the CRL standard, OpenBao must
read **all** revoked certificates into memory in order to rebuild the CRL and
clients must fetch the regenerated CRL.

This secrets engine does not support multiple CRL endpoints with sliding date
windows; often such mechanisms will have the transition point a few days apart,
but this gets into the expected realm of the actual certificate validity periods
issued from this secrets engine. A good rule of thumb for this secrets engine
would be to simply not issue certificates with a validity period greater than
your maximum comfortable CRL lifetime. Alternately, you can control CRL caching
behavior on the client to ensure that checks happen more often.

Often multiple endpoints are used in case a single CRL endpoint is down so that
clients don't have to figure out what to do with a lack of response. Run OpenBao
in HA mode, and the CRL endpoint should be available even if a particular node
is down.

:::warning

Note: When using multiple issuers in the same mount point,
   different issuers may have different CRLs (depending on subject and key
   material). This means that OpenBao may need to regenerate multiple CRLs.
   This is again a rationale for keeping TTLs short and avoiding revocation
   if possible.

:::

:::warning

Note: OpenBao supports two complementary revocation mechanisms: Delta CRLs,
   which allow for rebuilds of smaller, incremental additions to the last
   complete CRL, and OCSP, which allows responding to revocation status requests
   for individual certificates. When coupled with the new CRL auto-rebuild
   functionality, this means that the revoking step isn't as costly (as the CRL
   isn't always rebuilt on each revocation), outside of storage considerations.
   However, while the rebuild operation still can be expensive with lots of
   certificates, it will be done on a schedule rather than on demand.

:::

### NotAfter behavior on leaf certificates

The PKI Secrets Engine supports a `leaf_not_after_behavior` [parameter on
issuers](/api-docs/secret/pki#leaf_not_after_behavior).  This allows
modification of the issuance behavior: should OpenBao `err`, preventing issuance
of a longer-lived leaf cert than issuer, silently `truncate` to that of the
issuer's `NotAfter` value, or `permit` longer expirations.

It is strongly suggested to use `err` or `truncate` for intermediates;
`permit` is only useful for root certificates, as intermediate's NotAfter
expiration are checked when validating presented chains.

In combination with a cascading expiration with longer lived roots (perhaps
on the range of 2-10 years), shorter lived intermediates (perhaps on the
range of 6 months to 2 years), and short-lived leaf certificates (on the
range of 30 to 90 days), and the [rotation strategies discussed in other
sections](/docs/secrets/pki/rotation-primitives), this should keep the
CRLs adequately small.

### Cluster performance and quantity of leaf certificates

As mentioned above, keeping TTLs short (or using `no_store=true`) and avoiding
leases is important for a healthy cluster. However it is important to note
this is a scale problem: 10-1000 long-lived, stored certificates are probably
fine, but 50k-100k become a problem and 500k+ stored, unexpired certificates
can negatively impact even large OpenBao clusters--even with short TTLs!

However, once these certificates are expired, a [tidy operation](/api-docs/secret/pki#tidy)
will clean up CRLs and OpenBao cluster storage.

Note that organizational risk assessments for certificate compromise might
mean certain certificate types should always be issued with `no_store=false`;
even short-lived broad wildcard certificates (say, `*.example.com`) might be
important enough to have precise control over revocation. However, an internal
service with a well-scoped certificate (say, `service.example.com`) might be
of low enough risk to issue a 90-day TTL with `no_store=true`, preventing
the need for revocation in the unlikely case of compromise.

Having a shorter TTL decreases the likelihood of needing to revoke a cert
(but cannot prevent it entirely) and decrease the impact of any such
compromise.

:::warning

Note: The PKI Secret Engine's [Bring-Your-Own-Cert
   (BYOC)](/api-docs/secret/pki#revoke-certificate) functionality allows
   revocation of certificates not previously stored (e.g., issued via a role
   with `no_store=true`). This means that setting `no_store=true` _is_ safe to
   be used globally, regardless of importance of issued certificates (and their
   likelihood for revocation).

:::

## You must configure issuing/CRL/OCSP information _in advance_

This secrets engine serves CRLs from a predictable location, but it is not
possible for the secrets engine to know where it is running. Therefore, you must
configure desired URLs for the issuing certificate, CRL distribution points, and
OCSP servers manually using the `config/urls` endpoint. It is supported to have
more than one of each of these by passing in the multiple URLs as a
comma-separated string parameter.

:::warning

Note: When using multiple issuers in the same mount, it is suggested to use
   the per-issuer AIA fields rather than the global (`/config/urls`) variant.
   This is for correctness: these fields are used for chain building and
   automatic CRL detection in certain applications. If they point to the wrong
   issuer's information, these applications may break.

:::

## Distribution of CRLs and OCSP

Both CRLs and OCSP allow interrogating revocation status of certificates. Both
of these methods include internal security and authenticity (both CRLs and
OCSP responses are signed by the issuing CA within OpenBao). This means both are
fine to distribute over non-secure and non-authenticated channels, such as
HTTP.

## Automate CRL building and tidying

The PKI Secrets Engine supports automated CRL rebuilding (including optional
Delta CRLs which can be built more frequently than complete CRLs) via the
`/config/crl` endpoint. Additionally, tidying of revoked and expired
certificates can be configured automatically via the `/config/auto-tidy`
endpoint. Both of these should be enabled to ensure compatibility with the wider
PKIX ecosystem and performance of the cluster.

## Spectrum of revocation support

The PKI secrets engine has the ability to support a spectrum of cluster sizes
and certificate revocation quantities.

For users with few revocations or who want a unified view and have the
inter-cluster bandwidth to support it, we recommend turning on auto
rebuilding of CRLs, cross-cluster revocation queues, and cross-cluster CRLs.
This allows all consumers of the CRLs to have the most accurate picture of
revocations, regardless of which cluster they talk to.

If the unified CRL becomes too big for the underlying storage mechanism or
for a single host to build, we recommend relying on OCSP instead of CRLs.
These have much smaller storage entries, and the CRL `disabled` flag is
independent of `unified_crls`, allowing unified OCSP to remain.

However, when cross-cluster traffic becomes too high (or if CRLs are still
necessary in addition to OCSP), we recommend sharding the CRL between
different clusters. This has been the default behavior of OpenBao, but with
the introduction of per-cluster, templated AIA information, the leaf
certificate's Authority Information Access (AIA) info will point directly
to the cluster which issued it, allowing the correct CRL for this cert to
be identified by the application. This more correctly mimics the behavior
of [Let's Encrypt's CRL sharding](https://letsencrypt.org/2022/09/07/new-life-for-crls.html).

This sharding behavior can also be used for OCSP, if the cross-cluster
traffic for revocation entries becomes too high.

For users who wish to manage revocation manually, using the audit logs to
track certificate issuance would allow an external system to identify which
certificates were issued. These can be manually tracked for revocation, and
a [custom CRL can be built](/api-docs/secret/pki#combine-crls-from-the-same-issuer)
using externally tracked revocations. This would allow usage of roles set to
`no_store=true`, so OpenBao is strictly used as an issuing authority and isn't
storing any certificates, issued or revoked. For the highest of revocation
volumes, this could be the best option.

Notably, this last approach can either be used for the creation of externally
stored unified or sharded CRLs. If a single external unified CRL becomes
unreasonably large, each cluster's certificates could have AIA info point
to an externally stored and maintained, sharded CRL. However,
OpenBao has no mechanism to sign OCSP requests at this time.

## Automate leaf certificate renewal

To manage certificates for services at scale, it is best to automate the
certificate renewal as much as possible. OpenBao Agent [has support for
automatically renewing requested certificates](/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#certificates)
based on the `validTo` field. Other solutions might involve using
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) in Kubernetes or OpenShift, backed
by the OpenBao CA.

## Safe minimums

Since its inception, this secrets engine has enforced SHA256 for signature
hashes rather than SHA1. A minimum of 2048 bits for RSA keys is also enforced.
Software that can handle SHA256 signatures should also be able to handle
2048-bit keys, and 1024-bit keys are considered unsafe and are disallowed in the
Internet PKI.

## Token lifetimes and revocation

When a token expires, it revokes all leases associated with it. This means that
long-lived CA certs need correspondingly long-lived tokens, something that is
easy to forget. Root and intermediate CA certs don't have associated leases, to
prevent unintended revocation when not using a token with a long enough
lifetime. To revoke these certificates, use the `pki/revoke` endpoint.

## Safe usage of roles

The OpenBao PKI Secrets Engine supports many options to limit issuance via
[Roles](/api-docs/secret/pki#create-update-role).
Careful consideration of construction is necessary to ensure that more
permissions are not given than necessary. Additionally, roles should generally
do _one_ thing; multiple roles should be preferable over having too permissive
roles that allow arbitrary issuance (e.g., `allow_any_name` should generally
be used sparingly, if at all).

 - `allow_any_name` should generally be set to `false`; this is the default.
 - `allow_localhost` should generally be set to `false` for production
   services, unless listening on `localhost` is expected.
 - Unless necessary, `allow_wildcard_certificates` should generally be set to
   `false`. This is **not** the default due to backwards compatibility
   concerns.
   - This is especially necessary when `allow_subdomains` or `allow_glob_domains`
     are enabled.
 - `enforce_hostnames` should generally be enabled for TLS services; this is
   the default.
 - `allow_ip_sans` should generally be set to `false` (but defaults to `true`),
   unless IP address certificates are explicitly required.
 - When using short TTLs (< 30 days) or with high issuance volume, it is
   generally recommend to set `no_store` to `true` (defaults to `false`).
   This prevents revocation but allows higher throughput as OpenBao no longer
   needs to store every issued certificate. This is discussed more in the
   [Replicated Datasets](#replicated-datasets) section below.
 - Do not use roles with root certificates (`issuer_ref`). Root certificates
   should generally only issue intermediates (see the section on [CA hierarchy
   above](#use-a-ca-hierarchy)), which doesn't rely on roles.
 - Limit `key_usage` and `ext_key_usage`; don't attempt to allow all usages
   for all purposes. Generally the default values are useful for client and
   server TLS authentication.

## Telemetry

Beyond OpenBao's default telemetry around request processing, PKI exposes count and
duration metrics for the issue, sign, sign-verbatim, and revoke calls. The
metrics keys take the form `mount-path,operation,[failure]` with labels for
namespace and role name.

Note that these metrics are per-node and thus would need to be aggregated across
nodes and clusters.

## Auditing

Because OpenBao HMACs audit string keys by default, it is necessary to tune
PKI secrets mounts to get an accurate view of issuance that is occurring under

Note: Depending on usage of OpenBao, CRLs (and rarely, CA chains) can grow to
   be rather large. We don't recommend un-HMACing the `crl` field for this
   reason, but note that the recommendations below suggest to un-HMAC the
   `certificate` response parameter, which the CRL can be served in via
   the `/pki/cert/crl` API endpoint. Additionally, the `http_raw_body` can
   be used to return CRL both in PEM and raw binary DER form, so it is
   suggested not to un-HMAC that field to not corrupt the log format.<br /><br />
   If this is done with only a [syslog](/docs/audit/syslog) audit device,
   OpenBao can deny requests (with an opaque `500 Internal Error` message)
   after the action has been performed on the server, because it was
   unable to log the message.<br /><br />
   The suggested workaround is to either leave the `certificate` and `crl`
   response fields HMACed and/or to also enable the [`file`](/docs/audit/file)
   audit log type.

:::

Some suggested keys to un-HMAC for requests are as follows:

 - `csr` - the requested CSR to sign,
 - `certificate` - the requested self-signed certificate to re-sign or
   when importing issuers,
 - Various issuance-related overriding parameters, such as:
   - `issuer_ref` - the issuer requested to sign this certificate,
   - `common_name` - the requested common name,
   - `alt_names` - alternative requested DNS-type SANs for this certificate,
   - `other_sans` - other (non-DNS, non-Email, non-IP, non-URI) requested SANs for this certificate,
   - `ip_sans` - requested IP-type SANs for this certificate,
   - `uri_sans` - requested URI-type SANs for this certificate,
   - `ttl` - requested expiration date of this certificate,
   - `not_after` - requested expiration date of this certificate,
   - `serial_number` - the subject's requested serial number,
   - `key_type` - the requested key type,
   - `private_key_format` - the requested key format which is also
     used for the public certificate format as well,
 - Various role- or issuer-related generation parameters, such as:
   - `ou` - the subject's organizational unit,
   - `organization` - the subject's organization,
   - `country` - the subject's country code,
   - `locality` - the subject's locality,
   - `province` - the subject's province,
   - `street_address` - the subject's street address,
   - `postal_code` - the subject's postal code,
   - `permitted_dns_domains` - permitted DNS domains,
   - `policy_identifiers` - the requested policy identifiers when creating a role, and
   - `ext_key_usage_oids` - the extended key usage OIDs for the requested certificate.

Some suggested keys to un-HMAC for responses are as follows:

 - `certificate` - the certificate that was issued,
 - `issuing_ca` - the certificate of the CA which issued the requested
   certificate,
 - `serial_number` - the serial number of the certificate that was issued,
 - `error` - to show errors associated with the request, and
 - `ca_chain` - optional due to noise; the full CA chain of the issuer of
   the requested certificate.

:::warning

Note: These list of parameters to un-HMAC are provided as a suggestion and
   may not be exhaustive.

:::

The following keys are suggested **NOT** to un-HMAC, due to their sensitive
nature:

 - `private_key` - this response parameter contains the private keys
   generated by OpenBao during issuance, and
 - `pem_bundle` this request parameter is only used on the issuer-import
   paths and may contain sensitive private key material.

## Role-Based access

The following is a condensed example reference of ACLing the PKI Secrets
Engine. These are just a suggestion; other personas and policy approaches
may also be valid.

We suggest the following personas:

 - *Operator*;  a privileged user who manages the health of the PKI
   subsystem; manages issuers and key material.
 - *Agent*; a semi-privileged user that manages roles and handles
   revocation on behalf of an operator; may also handle delegated
   issuance. This may also be called an *administrator* or *role
   manager*.
 - *Advanced*; potentially a power-user or service that has access to
   additional issuance APIs.
 - *Requester*; a low-level user or service that simply requests certificates.
 - *Unauthed*; any arbitrary user or service that lacks an OpenBao token.

For these personas, we suggest the following ACLs, in condensed, tabular form:

## Cluster scalability

Most non-introspection operations in the PKI secrets engine require a write to
storage, and so are forwarded to the cluster's active node for execution.
This table outlines which operations can be executed on performance standby nodes
and thus scale horizontally across all nodes within a cluster.

| Path                          | Operations           |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| ca[/pem]                      | Read                 |
| cert/<em>serial-number</em>   | Read                 |
| cert/ca_chain                 | Read                 |
| config/crl                    | Read                 |
| certs                         | List                 |
| ca_chain                      | Read                 |
| crl[/pem]                     | Read                 |
| issue                         | Update <sup>\*</sup> |
| revoke/<em>serial-number</em> | Read                 |
| sign                          | Update <sup>\*</sup> |
| sign-verbatim                 | Update <sup>\*</sup> |

\* Only if the corresponding role has `no_store` set to true and `generate_lease`
set to false. If `generate_lease` is true the lease creation will be forwarded to
the active node; if `no_store` is false the entire request will be forwarded to
the active node.

## PSS support

Go lacks support for PSS certificates, keys, and CSRs using the `rsaPSS` OID
(`1.2.840.113549.1.1.10`). It requires all RSA certificates, keys, and CSRs
to use the alternative `rsaEncryption` OID (`1.2.840.113549.1.1.1`).

When using OpenSSL to generate CAs or CSRs from PKCS8-encoded PSS keys, the
resulting CAs and CSRs will have the `rsaPSS` OID. Go and OpenBao will reject
them. Instead, use OpenSSL to generate or convert to a PKCS#1v1.5 private
key file and use this to generate the CSR. OpenBao will, depending on the role
and the signing mechanism, still use a PSS signature despite the
`rsaEncryption` OID on the request as the SubjectPublicKeyInfo and
SignatureAlgorithm fields are orthogonal. When creating an external CA and
importing it into OpenBao, ensure that the `rsaEncryption` OID is present on
the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field even if the SignatureAlgorithm is PSS-based.

These certificates generated by Go (with `rsaEncryption` OID but PSS-based
signatures) are otherwise compatible with the fully PSS-based certificates.
OpenSSL and NSS support parsing and verifying chains using this type of
certificate. Note that some TLS implementations may not support these types
of certificates if they do not support `rsa_pss_rsae_*` signature schemes.
Additionally, some implementations allow rsaPSS OID certificates to contain
restrictions on signature parameters allowed by this certificate, but Go and
OpenBao do not support adding such restrictions.

Go additionally lacks support for creating OCSP responses with the PSS
signature algorithm. OpenBao will automatically downgrade issuers with
PSS-based revocation signature algorithms to PKCS#1v1.5, but note that
certain KMS devices (like HSMs and GCP) may not support this with the
same key. As a result, the OCSP responder may fail to sign responses,
returning an internal error.
