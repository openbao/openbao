# Declarative self-initialization

## Summary

OpenBao needs to make changes to improve provisioning and initialization in
order to facilitate day-zero automation and audited-by-default changes. We
suggest using an initialization structure based on request/response patterns,
with an optional output section for preserving any necessary responses. This
will improve operator experience by replacing manual post-startup steps with
greater end-to-end automation especially when orchestrated by an IaC tool.

## Problem Statement

OpenBao currently has a stateful, one-time initialization process. This makes
operating it in a fully declarative environment, such as NixOS or OpenTofu,
rather hard. In particular, initialization returns two items: a set of unseal
or recovery key shards and a highly privileged root token; some initial setup
using this root token should also be taken (such as initial auth method
creation, policies, and audit logging), before this root token is ideally
revoked. For auto-unseal, the initialization process does not yield necessary
unseal shards and all information required to unseal exists immediately on
first binary startup. Instead, recovery shards, used to generate new root
tokens, are returned from auto-unseal initializations. Without an initial root
token, no access to OpenBao is possible as no authentication methods are
configured.

Thus, simply initializing OpenBao and removing the need for the root token's
one-off use is insufficient unless recovery shares are placed elsewhere (in
a secure location) and used on subsequent configuration steps. Changes to
recovery key handling will be discussed in a subsequent RFC.

Ideally, initialization should set up an audit method, an initial policy, and
an auth method which would be used by the administrator via any declarative
policy. Then subsequent configuration could be entirely declarative and not
feature any one-time steps or one-time authentication methods. Only when an
operator is ready should one-time steps be taken, such as generating and
preserving long-term access to recovery keys.

However, each auth method and organization's policy requirements are
different. While we cannot seek to fully replace a declarative framework like
OpenTofu, we should have sufficient flexibility to define all initialization
up-front. Adding to this, output or request chaining is necessary: if OpenBao
creates a certificate authority, we may wish to make that available on disk
for other automation to use and deploy or reuse it in subsequent requests to
the instance during initialization (to e.g., configure a certificate auth
mount).

To bound the security risk, initialization configuration must only be applied
on first startup. It should not be treated as the long-term owner of these
resources and an import to a proper IaC tool would be preferable long-term.

We need this to interact nicely with existing configuration management
techniques; HCL and JSON-equivalent representations should be possible for
any initialization and we should not attempt to build a new DSL for this.

Lastly, whatever format is chosen should ultimately form the basis of the
[profile system](/blog/profiles/) and should ideally have some code reuse
with it.

## User-facing Description

Users will define one or more initialization blocks:

```hcl
initialize "identity" {
  request "mount-userpass" {
    operation = "update"
    path = "sys/auth/userpass"
    data = {
      type = "kv"
      path = "userpass/"
      description = "admin
    }
  }

  request "userpass-add-admin" {
    operation = "update"
    path = "auth/userpass/users/admin"
    data = {
      "password" = {
        type = "string"
        source = "env"
        env_var = "INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
      }
      "token_policies" = ["superuser"]
    }
  }
}

initialize "policy" {
  request "add-superuser-policy" {
    operation = "update"
    path = "sys/policies/acl/superuser"
    data = {
      policy = << EOP
path "*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update", "read", "delete", "list", "scan", "sudo"]
}
EOP
    }
  }
}
```

Equivalently in JSON this looks like:

```json
{
  "initialize": [
    {
      "audit": {
        "request": [
          {
            "enable-audit": {
              "operation": "update",
              "path": "sys/audit/stdout",
              "data": {
                "type": "file",
                "options": {
                  "file_path": "/dev/stdout",
                  "log_raw": true
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identity": {
        "request": [
          {
            "mount-userpass": {
              "operation": "update",
              "path": "sys/auth/userpass",
              "data": {
                "type": "userpass",
                "path": "userpass/",
                "description": "admin"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "userpass-add-admin": {
              "operation": "update",
              "path": "auth/userpass/users/admin",
              "data": {
                "password": {
                  "eval_type": "string",
                  "eval_source": "env",
                  "env_var": "INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
                },
                "token_policies": ["superuser"]
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "policy": {
        "request": [
          {
            "add-superuser-policy": {
              "operation": "update",
              "path": "sys/policies/acl/superuser",
              "data": {
                "policy": "path \"*\" {\n  capabilities = [\"create\", \"update\", \"read\", \"delete\", \"list\", \"scan\", \"sudo\"]\n}"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Items which ultimately need literals (such as operations, paths, &c) can
alternatively take an object, defining an output type (`string`, `int`, &c)
and a source (`env`, `file`, `request.data`, `response.data`, &c) to serve
as the source value for the field.

Initialization will occur in the order provided by the configuration file
[ordering](../configuration/index.mdx): each initialization block is executed in
the order they appear in the configuration file and blocks in different
files are executed in alphabetically sorted order.

In the future, `for_each` might be a valid object, taking an iterable
structure (perhaps a `LIST` result, a set of files in a directory, &c) and
a template set of requests to apply with each item yielded by the iterable.
This would allow blanket creation of policies from a directory, for instance.

## Technical Description

This will hook into `command.ServerCommand.Run(...)` as an alternative to
`command.initDevCore(...)`. Like how `command.ServerCommand.enableDev(...)`
performs requests into the Core and directly performs initialization, the
new self-initialization call will operate in a similar fashion.

### Profile System

This starts development on a profile system. Generally, the profile system
takes a request handler (taking `*logical.Request` and yielding a
`*logical.Response`) and a parsed profile configuration, templating it into
one or more requests to the handler. Such templating supports custom data
sources via the `eval_source` parameter, such as:

 - `env`, to support reading environment variables;
 - `file`, to support reading files from disk;
 - `request` and `response`, to support reading the data from past requests
   and responses; and
 - `template`, to support using the `sdk/helpers/template` helpers.

These are configurable by the profile engine: `env` and `file` should not be
used to implement the suggested [API profiles](/blog/profiles/) as they allow
accessing arbitrary environment variables or files on disk.

While the profile system for self-initialization executes requests directly,
this could be hooked into a storage-based approach, allowing incremental
profile evaluation, and allow output of incremental responses or debugging.

This should live in `/helpers/profiles` for use by other callers.

## Rationale and Alternatives

The request/response chanining structure does not use any HCL-specific features,
outside of potential templating or function invocation, and thus could be portable
to any other configuration language in the future.

This greatly improves the operator experience, solving early initialization issues.

We do have some prior art: `bao server -dev` supports a command-line flag,
`-dev-root-token-id`, which [writes into
storge](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/ef8d04c6cbc14fd34e68f0fd4071faf06e528266/command/server.go#L1746-L1763)
a new root token. This token is persisted throughout the lifetime of the
server, which in dev-mode is safely bounded by restart and is not intended
for production. One issue with this alternative approach is that we do not
have a safe bound for production servers: a persistent root token would be
valid indefinitely, letting any leak gain root access. Similarly, there's
confusion around behavior if this value were to change: should we
administratively create a new one? Replace the old one? &c. A one-time
initialization is very clearly scoped and lets proper authentication
mechanisms take over sooner.

## Downsides

The initialization-via-requests approach is rather flexible and generic,
requiring some familiarity with the desired API calls to implement. However,
users will ultimately have great control over the desired requests.

## Security Implications

One-time initialization limits scope versus continual re-initialization
(config-based management). The decisions around delaying initial recovery
[key creation](authenticated-rekey.mdx) are part of a separate RFC
with security implications discussed there.

Otherwise, this is functionally equivalent to an operator manually wrapping
the OpenBao binary with a custom script which implements this themselves,
but with hopefully greater reliability.

## User/Developer Experience

This does not impact end users at all. For operators, this provides a
significantly easier getting started path, assuming familiarity with the
system and the available endpoints, and lets us have fully declaratively
configurable instances that integrate nicely into other IaC providers like
OpenTofu from initial startup.
