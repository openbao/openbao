# Integrated Storage (Raft) backend

The Integrated Storage backend is used to persist OpenBao's data. Unlike other storage
backends, Integrated Storage does not operate from a single source of data. Instead
all the nodes in an OpenBao cluster will have a replicated copy of OpenBao's data.
Data gets replicated across all the nodes via the [Raft Consensus
Algorithm][raft].


:::tip

**High Availability** – the Integrated Storage (Raft) backend supports High Availability.

:::

:::tip

**Production Ready** – the Integrated Storage (Raft) backend is considered
production ready and supports paginated lists and transactional storage.

:::

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "raft_node_1"
}
cluster_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8201"
```

:::warning

**Note:** When using the Integrated Storage backend, it is required to provide
[`cluster_addr`](/docs/concepts/ha#per-node-cluster-address) to indicate the address and port to be used for communication
between the nodes in the Raft cluster.

:::

:::warning

**Note:** When using the Integrated Storage backend, a separate
[`ha_storage`](/docs/configuration#ha_storage)
backend cannot be declared.

## `raft` parameters

- `path` `(string: "")` – The file system path where all the OpenBao data gets
  stored.
  This value can be overridden by setting the `VAULT_RAFT_PATH` environment variable.

- `node_id` `(string: "")` - The identifier for the node in the Raft cluster.
  This value can be overridden by setting the `VAULT_RAFT_NODE_ID` environment variable.

- `performance_multiplier` `(integer: 0)` - An integer multiplier used by
  servers to scale key Raft timing parameters. Tuning this affects the time it
  takes OpenBao to detect leader failures and to perform leader elections, at the
  expense of requiring more network and CPU resources for better performance.
  Omitting this value or setting it to 0 uses default timing described below.
  Lower values are used to tighten timing and increase sensitivity while higher
  values relax timings and reduce sensitivity.

  By default, OpenBao will use a lower-performance timing that's suitable for
  minimal OpenBao servers, currently equivalent to setting this to a value of 5
  (this default may be changed in future versions of OpenBao, depending if the
  target minimum server profile changes). Setting this to a value of 1 will
  configure Raft to its highest-performance mode and is recommended for
  production OpenBao servers. The maximum allowed value is 10.

- `trailing_logs` `(integer: 10000)` - This controls how many log entries are
  left in the log store on disk after a snapshot is made. This should only be
  adjusted when followers cannot catch up to the leader due to a very large
  snapshot size and high write throughput causing log truncation before a
  snapshot can be fully installed. If you need to use this to recover a cluster,
  consider reducing write throughput or the amount of data stored on OpenBao. The
  default value is 10000 which is suitable for all normal workloads. The
  `trailing_logs` metric is not the same as `max_trailing_logs`.

- `snapshot_threshold` `(integer: 8192)` - This controls the minimum number of Raft
  commit entries between snapshots that are saved to disk. This is a low-level
  parameter that should rarely need to be changed. Very busy clusters
  experiencing excessive disk IO may increase this value to reduce disk IO and
  minimize the chances of all servers taking snapshots at the same time.
  Increasing this trades off disk IO for disk space since the log will grow much
  larger and the space in the `raft.db` file can't be reclaimed till the next
  snapshot. Servers may take longer to recover from crashes or failover if this
  is increased significantly as more logs will need to be replayed.

- `snapshot_interval` `(integer: 120 seconds)` - The snapshot interval
   controls how often Raft checks whether a snapshot operation is
   required. Raft randomly staggers snapshots between the configured
   interval and twice the configured interval to keep the entire cluster
   from performing a snapshot at once. The default snapshot interval is
   120 seconds.

- `retry_join` `(list: [])` - A set of connection details for another node in the
  cluster, which is used to help nodes locate a leader in order to join a cluster.
  There can be one or more [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) stanzas.

  If the connection details for all nodes in the cluster are known in advance, you
  can include these stanzas to enable nodes to automatically join the Raft cluster.
  Once one of the nodes is initialized as the leader, the remaining nodes will use
  their [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) configuration to locate the leader and
  join the cluster. Note that when using Shamir seal, the joined nodes will still
  need to be unsealed manually.
  See [the section below](#retry_join-stanza) for the parameters accepted by the
  [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) stanza.

- `retry_join_as_non_voter` `(boolean: false)` - If set, causes any `retry_join`
  config to join the Raft cluster as a non-voter. The node will not participate
  in the Raft quorum but will still receive the data replication stream, adding
  read scalability to a cluster. This option has the same effect as the
  [`-non-voter`](/docs/commands/operator/raft#non-voter) flag for the
  `bao operator raft join` command, but only affects voting status when joining
  via `retry_join` config. This setting can be overridden to true by setting the
  `VAULT_RAFT_RETRY_JOIN_AS_NON_VOTER` environment variable to any non-empty value.
  Only valid if there is at least one `retry_join` stanza.

- `max_entry_size` `(integer: 1048576)` - This configures the maximum number of
  bytes for a Raft entry. It applies to Put operations: Any put operation exceeding
  this configuration value will cause the respective operation to fail. Raft has a
  suggested max size of data in a Raft log entry. This is based on current
  architecture, default timing, etc. Integrated Storage also uses a chunk size that
  is the threshold used for breaking a large value into chunks. By default, the
  chunk size is the same as Raft's max size log entry. The default value for this
  configuration is 1048576 -- two times the chunking size.

- `max_transaction_size` `(integer: 8388608)` - This configures the maximum
  number of bytes for a Raft entry containing a [transaction](/docs/rfcs/transactions).
  Each individual operation within a transaction must still be less than the
  size of a maximum entry (`max_entry_size`). This defaults to 16 times the
  minimum chunking size and must be set independently of `max_entry_size`.

- `autopilot_reconcile_interval` `(string: "10s")` - This is the interval after
  which autopilot will pick up any state changes. State change could mean multiple
  things; for example a newly joined voter node, initially added as non-voter to
  the Raft cluster by autopilot has successfully completed the stabilization
  period thereby qualifying for being promoted as a voter, a node that has become
  unhealthy and needs to be shown as such in the state API, a node has been marked
  as dead needing eviction from Raft configuration, etc.

- `autopilot_update_interval` `(string: "2s")` - This is the interval after which
  autopilot will poll OpenBao for any updates to the information it cares about. This
  includes things like the autopilot configuration, current autopilot state, raft
  configuration, known servers, latest raft index, and stats for all the known servers.
  The information that autopilot receives will be used to calculate its next state.

### `retry_join` stanza

- `leader_api_addr` `(string: "")` - Address of a possible leader node.

- `auto_join` `(string: "")` - Cloud auto-join configuration, using
  [go-discover](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover) syntax.

- `auto_join_scheme` `(string: "")` - The optional URI protocol scheme for addresses
  discovered via auto-join. Available values are `http` or `https`.

- `auto_join_port` `(uint: "")` - The optional port used for addressed discovered
  via auto-join.

- `leader_tls_servername` `(string: "")` - The TLS server name to use when
  connecting with HTTPS.
  Should match one of the names in the [DNS
  SANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) of the remote
  server certificate.
  See also [Integrated Storage and TLS](/docs/concepts/integrated-storage#autojoin-with-tls-servername)

- `leader_ca_cert_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the CA cert of the
  possible leader node.

- `leader_client_cert_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the client certificate
  for the follower node to establish client authentication with the possible
  leader node.

- `leader_client_key_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the client key for the
  follower node to establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

- `leader_ca_cert` `(string: "")` - CA cert of the possible leader node.

- `leader_client_cert` `(string: "")` - Client certificate for the follower node
  to establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

- `leader_client_key` `(string: "")` - Client key for the follower node to
  establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

Each [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) block may provide TLS certificates via
file paths or as a single-line certificate string value with newlines delimited
by `\n`, but not a combination of both. Each [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza)
stanza may contain either a [`leader_api_addr`](#leader_api_addr) value or a
cloud [`auto_join`](#auto_join) configuration value, but not both. When an
[`auto_join`](#auto_join) value is provided, OpenBao will automatically attempt to
discover and resolve potential Raft leader addresses using [go-discover](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover).
See the go-discover
[README](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover/blob/master/README.md)
for details on the format of the `auto_join` value.

By default, OpenBao will attempt to reach discovered peers using HTTPS and port 8200. Operators may override these through the
[`auto_join_scheme`](#auto_join_scheme) and [`auto_join_port`](#auto_join_port)
fields respectively.

Example Configuration:

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/Users/foo/raft/"
  node_id = "node1"

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.2:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca1"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert1"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key1"
  }
  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.3:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca2"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert2"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key2"
  }
  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.4:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca3"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert3"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key3"
  }
  retry_join {
    auto_join = "provider=aws region=eu-west-1 tag_key=openbao tag_value=... access_key_id=... secret_access_key=..."
  }
}
```
