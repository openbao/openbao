# Utimaco HSMs

This guide describes the steps to configure Auto-Unsealing for OpenBao using
[Utimaco General Purpose HSMs](https://utimaco.com/data-protection/gp-hsm) via
PKCS#11. Specifically, this guide covers both the u.trust GP HSM (PKCS#11 v3)
and CryptoServer CP5 (PKCS#11 v2) series.

:::warning

Securely operating Utimaco's HSMs in production requires significantly more
knowledge than what is described here. This guide exists to provide a focused
summary and quickstart configuration specifically for integration with OpenBao.
It is not a replacement for official Utimaco documentation, which provides much
higher detail around general HSM operation.

:::

## Initial Setup

This guide assumes that:

- The HSM has already been deployed and is accessible from your machine (either
  over the network or via PCIe)
- An admin account key is available to manage a PKCS#11 slot, or a PKCS#11
  slot and user have already been initialized

Utimaco HSMs come with several command line tools that will be used throughout
this guide. Ensure the following are available:

- `csadm` - HSM administration
- `cxitool` - Manage and interact with cryptographic functionality
- `p11tool2` - PKCS#11 specific functions, not to be confused with GNU `p11tool`

To begin, set the `CRYPTOSERVER` environment variable to point `csadm` and `cxitool` at the HSM:

```shell-session
$ export CRYPTOSERVER=288@194.168.4.107
```

Depending on your device, use:

- `CRYPTOSERVER=<PORT>:<ADDRESS>` to connect over the network
- `CRYPTOSERVER=/dev/cs2.<INDEX>` to connect to an attached PCIe card

Verify that the HSM is reachable:

```shell-session
$ csadm GetState

mode      = Operational Mode
state     = INITIALIZED (0x00100004)

-- more output --
```

Then set `CS_AUTH_KEYS` and download the HSM's public key:

```shell-session
$ export CS_AUTH_KEYS=/etc/utimaco/HSM_AUTH.kak
$ csadm GetHSMAuthKey > "$CS_AUTH_KEYS"
```

This key is required to authenticate against the HSM in combination with your
user's private key.

Finally, create a configuration file for `p11tool2`. This file can be placed
at an arbitrary location, but you must point at it by setting an environment
variable.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="u.trust GP HSM" heading="utrust-p11tool">

```shell-session
$ export CS_PKCS11_R3_CFG=/etc/utimaco/cs_pkcs11_R3.cfg
```

Then place _at least_ the following at /etc/utimaco/cs_pkcs11_R3.cfg:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="CryptoServer CP5" heading="cryptoserver-p11tool">

```shell-session
$ export CS_PKCS11_R2_CFG=/etc/utimaco/cs_pkcs11_R2.cfg
```

Then place _at least_ the following at /etc/utimaco/cs_pkcs11_R2.cfg:

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

```ini
[Global]

# No required options here, but the section must exist.

[CryptoServer]

# This is equal to $CRYPTOSERVER
Device = 288@194.168.4.107
```

There are many more options available, and the above is only the minimum
required configuration. Refer to Utimaco's official PKCS#11 guide (delivered
together with your HSM) for an exhaustive list.

This will make PKCS#11 slots 0-9 available by default.

## Initializing a PKCS#11 Slot

:::info

If you have already initialized a PKCS#11 slot, you may skip to the [next
section](#creating-the-key-material)

:::

Next, initialize a PKCS#11 slot and assign a Security Officer PIN + User PIN to
it. For the purpose of this guide, we use slot number 1 and dummy PIN values of
`4321` for the Security Officer, and `1234` for the User.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="u.trust GP HSM" heading="utrust-slot">

Initialize the slot using an administrator account and set the SO PIN:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 Login=ADMIN,/etc/utimaco/ADMIN.key InitToken=temp
```

Change the initial SO PIN to fully activate the account:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginSO=temp SetPin=temp,4321
```

Then set the User PIN using the SO PIN:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginSO=4321 InitPIN=temp
```

...and also change the initial User PIN at least once to enable the account:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginUser=temp SetPIN=temp,1234
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="CryptoServer CP5" heading="cryptoserver-slot">

Initialize the slot using an administrator account and set the SO PIN:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 Login=ADMIN,/etc/utimaco/ADMIN.key InitToken=4321
```

Then set the User PIN using the SO PIN:

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginSO=4321 InitPIN=1234
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

PIN complexity requirements may (and should) be more complex in reality. Ensure
that the PIN assignment process makes sense for your organization, especially
when reassigning initial PINs.

## Creating the Key Material

The PKCS#11 seal supports both AES (via AES-GCM) and RSA (via RSA-OAEP) keys,
which are both sufficiently supported by Utimaco HSMs. Below commands generate
the corresponding key or key pair.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="AES key for AES-GCM" heading="AES">

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginUser=1234 KeyAttr=CKA_LABEL=bao-root-key-aes GenerateKey=AES
```

You can adjust `CKA_LABEL` as you see fit, or use `CKA_ID` instead. This value
will be used to reference the key later on.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="RSA key pair for RSA-OAEP" heading="RSA">

RSA key pairs are created with sign/verify usage by default. This must be
explicitly overridden into encrypt/decrypt instead. Generally, the HSM will not
allow RSA key pairs with both sign/verify and encrypt/decrypt usage enabled.

```shell-session
$ p11tool2 Slot=1 LoginUser=1234 \
    PrvKeyAttr=CKA_LABEL=bao-root-key-rsa,CKA_DECRYPT=CK_TRUE \
    PubKeyAttr=CKA_LABEL=bao-root-key-rsa,CKA_ENCRYPT=CK_TRUE,CKA_MODULUS_BITS=4096 \
    GenerateKeyPair=RSA
```

You can adjust `CKA_LABEL` as you see fit, or use `CKA_ID` instead. This
value will be used to reference the key later on. Ensure that both the public
and private key share the exact same ID or label! OpenBao will have trouble
identifying the key pair otherwise.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Key Authorization

The CryptoServer CP5 series requires keys to be initialized and authorized
before use.

:::info

This section is not relevant for u.trust GP HSMs. You may skip to the [next
section](#installing-the-library).

:::

Begin by generating a key authorization key (KAK) if not yet present. This is
always an RSA key.

```sh
$ csadm GenKey=/etc/utimaco/KAK.key,4096,"CryptoServer User"
generating RSA key: /etc/utimaco/KAK.key, 4096 bits, owner: CryptoServer User
```

:::warning

The KAK is written to your local file system and **not** stored in the HSM. Be
sure to keep it safe and not to lose it.

:::

Key authorization is performed via `cxitool`, not `p11tool2`. Since `cxitool` is
not specific to PKCS#11, terminology is slightly different, but still maps back
to the corresponding PKCS#11 primitives.

Start by listing the available keys. You will need to provide a `LogonPass`
parameter of format `USR_<SLOT_NUMBER>,<USER_PIN>` where `<SLOT_NUMBER>` is
padded to 4 digits. See an example below:

```shell-session
$ cxitool LogonPass=USR_0001,1234 ListKeys

idx algo  size type     group                    name                             spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1   AES   256  sec      SLOT_0001                                                 1
2   RSA   4096 pub      SLOT_0001                                                 2
3   RSA   4096 prv      SLOT_0001                                                 3
```

If there are several keys and you are unsure which is the one you created via
`p11tool2`, use the `KeyInfo` command to inspect the key's label:

```shell-session
$ cxitool LogonPass=USR_0000,1234 Group=SLOT_0001 Spec=1 KeyInfo

-- more output --

Group         : SLOT_0001
Label         : bao-root-key-aes

-- more output --
```

Next, initialize and authorize the key. You will need the "group" and "spec"
values of the key for this. Note that for RSA key pairs, these steps are only
required for the private key half.

Initialize the key:

```shell-session
$ cxitool LogonPass=USR_0001,1234 Group=SLOT_0001 \
    Spec=1 KeyFile=/etc/utimaco/KAK.key InitializeKey
```

Authorize the key:

```shell-session
$ cxitool LogonPass=USR_0001,1234 Group=SLOT_0001 \
    Spec=1 KeyFile=/etc/utimaco/KAK.key AuthorizeKey
```

:::warning

The above authorization step must be repeated each time the HSM is restarted.
The initialization step is only required once.

:::

The key is now ready to use for Auto-Unsealing.

## Installing the Library

OpenBao will interact with the HSM using the PKCS#11 dynamic library. You will
need to make this library available on the system that OpenBao will run on, e.g.
a container, VM, or even a bare metal machine.

Depending on the HSM (and thus, PKCS#11 version), the dynamic library file is:

| HSM              | PKCS#11 Library      | PKCS#11 Version |
| -----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| CryptoServer CP5 | `libcs_pkcs11_R2.so` | v2              |
| u.trust GP HSM   | `libcs_pkcs11_R3.so` | v3              |

You can place this file at any location on the system accessible to the
OpenBao server.

If you are looking to conveniently inject the library into a
container, have a look at the sibling [guide on the SecuroSys Primus
HSM](/docs/guides/unseal/pkcs11/securosys), which contains plenty of
Kubernetes-specific strategies that apply to any PKCS#11 library.

The PKCS#11 library is configured the same way the `p11tool2` tool is. This
configuration must also be available for OpenBao at runtime. To recap, the
following environment variables must be set and must point to valid paths and
resources:

- `CRYPTOSERVER`
- `CS_AUTH_KEYS`
- `CS_PKCS11_R2_CFG` or `CS_PKCS11_R3_CFG`, depending on the HSM

:::note

OpenBao must be compiled with HSM support to load the library. HSM-enabled
binaries, packages and container images are generally available as part of
OpenBao's releases.

:::

:::note

Utimaco's PKCS#11 libraries require Glibc and do not work on systems based on
the Musl C library, such as Alpine Linux. For container users, this means you
must use the `openbao-hsm-ubi` instead of the Alpine-based `openbao-hsm` image.

:::

## Configuring the PKCS#11 Seal

Below is an exemplary PKCS#11 seal configuration stanza to be placed in the
OpenBao server configuration. Replace the `lib` value with the path that you
placed the PKCS#11 library at in the previous step, and set `slot`, `pin` and
`key_label` based on the values you chose during slot initialization and key
material generation.

```hcl
seal "pkcs11" {
  lib       = "/usr/local/lib/libcs_pkcs11_R3.so"
  slot      = 1
  pin       = "1234"
  key_label = "bao-root-key-aes"
}
```

See [PKCS#11 Seal](/docs/configuration/seal/pkcs11) for complete documentation
on all available options, or how to set the above values via environment
variables instead.

## Initializing OpenBao

With the key material, environment variables, dynamic library and
server configuration all in place, start the OpenBao server. Unless
[Self-initialization](/docs/configuration/self-init) is used or a [Seal
Migration](/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) is performed, the final step is
to manually initialize OpenBao:

```shell-session
$ bao operator init
```

If all is configured correctly, the server should unseal automatically following
the initialization. If this is not the case, check the server logs for error
messages.
