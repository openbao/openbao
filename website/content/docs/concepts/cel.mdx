# CEL in OpenBao

The Common Expression Language (CEL) is used in PKI and JWT to declare validation rules
and policies:
- [CEL for JWT Auth](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/cel-jwt/)
- [CEL in PKI](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/cel-pki/)

The main CEL `Expression` in a `Celprogram` is typically one line of code. This can be broken down
into multiple CEL expressions by using `CelVariable`'s. The following sections cover how to build
a `CelProgram` in any part of OpenBao.

## Main expression
- This is the main expression that determines whether a CEL program has accepted or rejected
a request.

- The main expression in the `CelProgram` should return the engine's
  specific output object on success, for instance:
    * PKI → `ValidationOutput`
    * JWT/OIDC → `pb.Auth`

- A custom `string` error message or `bool` should be returned on
  failure. The error message can be constructed using a CEL expression.
  For instance: 
  ```go
  require_cn ? 'request should have a common_name' : (validate_ttl ? 'request has invalid TTL' : "Request Rejected")
  ```

- Use a ternary operator when writing a main expression for clarity
  and to guarantee a value is always produced:
  ```go
  cond ? SuccessObject : error string/bool
  ```

## Variables in a CelProgram
- A variable is a named expression that can be referred later in other variables and expressions.

- They are useful if an expression is too long or has reusable parts.

- The order of variables matters since they are added into the CEL environment in the order they
  are defined. A variable can reference only variables declared _before_ it, not ones that come later.

### Definition
```go
// Name of the variable.
Name: string
// CEL expression for the variable
Expression: string
```

### Example
``` go
{
  "name":       "small_ttl",
  "expression": `has(request.ttl) && duration(request.ttl) < duration("4h")`,
},
```

## CelProgram
- A `CelProgram` is made of 2 parts:
  - A list of `CelVariable`'s.
  The CEL variables are declared in the CEL env so that they can be accessed by other
  variables as well as the main expression.

  - A main expression which determines whether the CEL program succeeds or fails.

### Definition
```go
// List of variables with explicit order (optional)
Variables: []CelVariable
// Required, the main CEL expression
Expression: string
```

### Example
```go
"cel_program": map[string]interface{}{
  "variables": []map[string]interface{}{
    {
      "name":       "validate_cn",
      "expression": `has(request.common_name) && request.common_name == "example.com"`,
    },
    {
      "name":       "small_ttl",
      "expression": `has(request.ttl) && duration(request.ttl) < duration("4h")`,
    },
    {
      "name":       "cn_value",
      "expression": "request.common_name",
    },
    {
      "name":       "not_after",
      "expression": "now + duration(request.ttl)",
    },
    {
      "name": "cert",
      "expression": `CertTemplate{
        Subject: PKIX.Name{                   
        CommonName: cn_value,
        },
        NotBefore: now,
        NotAfter: not_after,						
      }`,
    },
    {
      "name": "output",
      "expression": `ValidationOutput{
        template:        cert,
        generate_lease:  small_ttl,
        no_store:        !small_ttl,						
      }`,
    },
    {
      "name":       "err",
      "expression": "'Request should have common_name'",
    },
  },
  "expression": "validate_cn ? output : err",
},
```

## The Request Object
- Every key/value pair in the request body is copied verbatim to the CEL
`request` map. The CEL program (not the endpoint) decides which
of these parameters to honour, ignore, or override.

- To avoid breaking existing automation, consider re-using familiar field
names such as `common_name` or `ttl`, even though CEL roles are not required
to follow the traditional role schema.
