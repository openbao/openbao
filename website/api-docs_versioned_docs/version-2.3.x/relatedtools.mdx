:::warning

**Note**: OpenBao intends to remain API compatible with HashiCorp Vault. This
means that most of the existing [tooling for
Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/relatedtools) should also
work with OpenBao.

:::

- [OpenBao Agent](/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent) can render OpenBao secrets either to files or directly into a child process as environment variables using `consul-template` templating syntax
- [OpenBao Proxy](/docs/agent-and-proxy/proxy) acts as an API Proxy for OpenBao, and can optionally allow or force interacting clients to use its automatically authenticated token
