# Better Operationalizing the PostgreSQL Storage Engine

## Summary

Operationalizing OpenBao with the PostgreSQL storage backend is currently not
a well-documented process. This document seeks to combine understanding of
various in-flight and finished RFCs along with proposing new changes to
improve the operator experience in certain environments.
 CockroachDB and PostgreSQL are both relational databases, but they differ significantly in their architecture and capabilities. CockroachDB is a distributed database, designed for scalability and fault tolerance across multiple nodes, while PostgreSQL is a single-node database known for its advanced features and ACID compliance.

## Problem Statement

While the PostgreSQL engine existed in upstream, it was an unsupported (from
a production environment and HashiCorp Support PoV) backend. OpenBao revived
this engine, aiming to make it fully supported. Notably, we included support
for [paginated lists](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/paginated-lists/) and
[transactional storage](https://openbao.org/docs/rfcs/transactions/) in our
revival of the engine after its [initial removal](https://openbao.org/docs/policies/plugins/#storage-backends).

Notably absent from existing documentation and [future
RFCs](https://gist.github.com/cipherboy/92828019e89d8adde219d08dec47e5a9) are
an understanding of the different environments OpenBao might run in:

 1. What load is expected on the database?
 2. Is the PostgreSQL expected to be dedicated or shared?
 3. How should OpenBao operate if it cannot create tables (e.g., when
    considering future work to split the monolithic table)?
 4. How are database _structure_ migrations supposed to occur, if OpenBao is
    not granted _migration_ rights?
 5. How does OpenBao interact with a replicated PostgreSQL cluster or database
    proxies such as PgBouncer, especially in a future with [horizontal
    scalability](https://openbao.org/blog/vision-for-namespaces/)?

Some of these are dependent on understanding the environment OpenBao is
running in and the expected workloads attached to it. For this, we seek to
[maintain an updated benchmarking tool](https://github.com/openbao/benchmark-openbao)
to help operators with discovery here.

## User-facing Description

We seek to split out three main lifecycle components of an application's
interactions with a database, inline with traditional best practices:

1. Initial database stand up (such as table creation),
2. Ongoing database migrations, and
3. Steady-state operations.

Currently (after [adding support for table creation](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/614)),
OpenBao mixes all three concerns in the main OpenBao `server` invocation.
Point two, ongoing database migrations, may be more complicated as OpenBao
currently does not have a mechanism for a plugin to indicate that data-level
migrations need to occur or to perform them.

## Technical Description

The following changes are suggested to improve operational behavior of
OpenBao.

### Add PostgreSQL init command line

Some OpenBao instances will not receive credentials with permission to create
new tables within the database. However, operators may still want to automate
this part of the process. We should add a new command line:

```
$ bao operator postgresql init
```

which takes either explicit credentials or a configuration file and performs
initialization.

If no credentials are given or they lack relevant permissions, we should
output database creation statements. The same should occur when the database
table exists but we need to perform a schema-level migration.

This tool would also benefit from a:

```
$ bao operator postgresql check -config=...
```

to validate connectivity, permissions, and supported versions.

### Add storage migration command line

The above `bao operator postgresql init` handles migration at the schema
level, but if downtime is acceptable, we may also wish to support an offline
data migration operation for data stored within the PostgreSQL database. Some
examples of past migrations include PKI and SSH multi-issuer storage layouts,
KVv1 to KVv2 migrations, &c.

This will require a full server configuration be available; any auto-unseal
mechanism will be required to perform unseal. No listeners will be started
and thus no audit logs will be generated.

This will look like:

```
$ bao operator storage migrate -config=...
```

In the event of using manual, Shamir's based unseal, the command line will
prompt for unseal shards. Parallelism should be controllable.

### Support storage entry invalidation

Raft supports storage-level invalidation natively, due to its vote-based
process. However, data written by the active OpenBao node may not be
immediately visible to standby nodes (if PostgreSQL replicas are in use)
and no native mechanism for update notifications exists.

Notably, use of [PostgreSQL's native `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html)
will not work as they are best-effort only and do not work across replicas.
In the event a PgBouncer instance re-establishes the connection without
informing OpenBao of an outage, OpenBao will lose any sent events within that
window.

**This requires a separate RFC when horizontal scalability is started.**

However, an initial design might be to include a new column in the schema:

```
CREATE TABLE openbao_kv_store (
    ... snip ...
    generation bigint,
    ... snip ...
);
```

where `generation` is an incrementing identifier on insert/update into the
field. An external active to follower replication mechanism (based on the
current follower to active GRPC) will allow sending notifications about
changes to storage. This will include the new generation UUID to tell if
this matches and thus to invalidate caches once the follower sees this entry
in storage (or any later revision). This will require the standby nodes poll
the current status of the entry. We will need to update the storage interface
to support returning the unique value generated by the underlying HA mechanism;
Raft will not need to implement it.

### Retrying PostgreSQL connection

One issue for operators in a Kubernetes environment is that the connection may
be through a proxy such as [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) or [Cloud
SQL Auth Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-auth-proxy).
This may start in a sidecar in parallel with OpenBao; thus OpenBao may fail to
connect on startup. Operators may need a retry loop or proxy startup detection
added to the OpenBao container.

We can simplify operationalizing by [including this retry in OpenBao
directly](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1280).

### Non-Voting Status in PostgreSQL

While PostgreSQL internally uses a [lock-based architecture](https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/storage/postgresql/#manually-creating-tables),
we still need the option to mark OpenBao nodes as non-voters so that they
never attempt to become the leader. This is especially important for
replicated database clusters; replicas are read-only and will err if a write
operation is performed.

We can introduce PostgreSQL [non-voting node support](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1284)
to solve this gap. When OpenBao supports read-request processing on standby
nodes, the status may be dynamically configurable at runtime by hitting an
API endpoint to promote and demote voter status.

### Empty Connection URLs

OpenBao uses [libpgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) which
[supports](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgconn#ParseConfig) standard
[PostgreSQL component-wise database connection environment
variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
However, it arbitrarily enforces a non-empty connection URL. Despite this,
the "empty" `postgres://` attribute works. This reduces operator cognitive
overhead, especially in places where standard component-wise constructs are
already in place.

This change is [already proposed for inclusion](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1297).

### Removing parallel locking

OpenBao's `postgresql` storage backend includes its own `PermitPool`,
ensuring `max_parallel` is enforced at the storage layer. However, it
also calls `db.SetMaxOpenConns(...)` which internally uses channels to
achive the same thing. We can remove the outer permit pool and rely
strictly on Go's implementation.

This change is [already proposed for inclusion](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1299).

### Lower default open connections

OpenBao defaults to 128 parallel connections; this is fine for Raft,
where reads are local and writes are batched and thus incur little
overhead for high pallelism, but not nice for database servers. Each
open connection incurs resources on the remote server and potentially
starves any other connections to the same instance. We should perform
some load testing and lower this to a reasonable value that still allows
parallelism but doesn't put undue stress on the remote server (5-20).

### Automatic max connections adjustment

Within some range, we might also consider dynamically adjusting the
value of max parallel, perhaps up to 25%, if we see consistent out of
connection errors. This might also wrap the default operation handlers,
so that we can automatically retry at the storage level if we get an
out-of-connections error especially if we've automatically adjusted.

This will make PostgreSQL more forgiving and OpenBao lighter on the
remote database server in times of load.

We may also want to scale back up the number of connections if we
time has passed.

### Document upgrade, backup, and restore procedures

Upgrading PostgreSQL, while never an easy tasks, should be easy in
OpenBao's case: we'll rely on basic features without extensions,
available at least in the [currently supported versions](https://endoflife.date/postgresql).
At some point, we should deprecate support for PostgreSQL 9.5 and
enforce a new minimum. Whether this will have `ha_enabled=true` by
default will be up for discussion then.

We should document that we do not intend to add the PostgreSQL
equivalent of the [`sys/storage/raft/snapshot`](https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/storage/raft/#take-a-snapshot-of-the-raft-cluster)
endpoint, and instead should rely on native, database-level [backup andd
restore procedures](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html).
This will be possible and durable especially after the remaining work
of [using transactions (#607)](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/607)
finishes.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This change is largely informs approaches to other external storage engines
that behave similarly to PostgreSQL, e.g., [#651](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/651).

## Downsides

This may add some new complexity to OpenBao to better support these types of
databases. However, PostgreSQL is an important alternative to internal storage
from a long-term maintainability and usability perspective.

## Security Implications

There should be no new security implications with these changes, unless noted
separately.

## User/Developer Experience

This does not change the end-user experience at all, merely improving operator
experience.

## Unresolved Questions

Not discussed in this RFC are any additional storage-API improvements
necessary for HA work. Until that is well understood (along with partitioning
of backends), it is suggested that external (pluggable) storage engines are
not added.
