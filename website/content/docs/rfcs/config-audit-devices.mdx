# Declarative Audit Device Configuration

## Summary

After [Vault HCSEC-2025-14 / CVE-2025-6000](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-14-privileged-vault-operator-may-execute-code-on-the-underlying-host/76033)
and [OpenBao CVE-2025-54997](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-xp75-r577-cvhp),
it became apparent that _any_ API-driven audit device creation is unsafe.
We remediate this fully by allowing full management of audit devices from
the configuration file, throughout the life cycle of the device.

## Problem Statement

API-driven audit device creation is fundamentally unsafe. Even without control
over `prefix`, audit devices of type `file` allow writing to arbitrary files
and type `socket` allows writing to arbitrary Unix or network sockets. These
operations are usually reserved for system-level operators, not API-level
administrators, breaching privilege separation expectations. These issues
were exacerbated in conjunction with the various privilege escalation bypasses
disclosed alongside this vulnerability.

Like introducing new, authenticated key rotation endpoints, we need a deeper
fix for the fundamental risks associated with this.

In a design similar to the [declarative self-initialization](self-init.mdx),
we opt to define audit devices in the configuration file. We need to make
sure we handle the following scenarios:

1. Creating a new audit device
2. Preventing duplicate audit devices (across API- and config-based creation)
3. Deleting an existing audit device
4. Preventing modification to an existing audit device.

## User-facing Description

We introduce a new repeatable configuration stanza, `audit "<type>" "<path>"`
which configures a new audit device:

```hcl
audit "file" "to-stdout" {
  description = "Default audit device"
  options = {
    file_path = "/dev/stdout"
    log_raw = "false"
  }
}
```

This can be added or removed and will be reprocessed on server restarts and
when `SIGHUP` is sent to the server. It will be ignored on standby nodes.

## Technical Description

This change is largely self-contained to the audit system and server
configuration parsing, with the exception of two necessary hooks:

1. The standard unseal strategy now updates audit devices based on the
   configuration.
2. The reload handlers triggered on `SIGHUP` now will reload the audit devices as
   well.

We differentiate API-created and configuration-based audit devices to prevent
confusion and deletion.

Otherwise, this change mostly reuses existing components.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This greatly improves the discoverability of audit devices, the configuration
and management of audit devices, and restores the usability of audit devices
after the fix for safety.

## Downsides

This has very limited downsides.

## Security Implications

This fixes the security definition of audit devices, reflecting their
privileged nature.

One observation remains: a malicious operator _could_ set `log_raw=true` on
audit devices, scraping all fetches or modifications made via the API. This
would be detectable by the consumer as the audit device HMAC endpoint would
be unable to create matching entries for known-logged strings.

However, said operator could also enable the `sys/raw` API and thus remains
equivalently privileged either way.

## User/Developer Experience

This change does not impact end-consumers of the OpenBao API.
