```release-note:feature
**Declarative Self-Initialization**: allow server operators to define initial
  service state through request-driven initialization that occurs
  automatically on first server start. Operators can reference environment
  variables and files to provision initial authentication, audit, and secret
  mounts in addition to having full control over general requests to OpenBao
  It is suggested to put the minimal necessary configuration in this and use
  a proper IaC platform like OpenTofu to perform further configuration of the
  instance.

```release-note:bug
storage/postgresql: more graceful handling of parallel table creation
