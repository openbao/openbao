# OpenBao CSI provider

The OpenBao CSI Provider allows pods to consume OpenBao secrets using
[CSI Secrets Store](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver) volumes.

:::warning

The OpenBao CSI Provider requires the [CSI Secret Store](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver)
Driver to be installed.

:::

## Overview

At a high level, the CSI Secrets Store driver allows users to create `SecretProviderClass` objects.
This object defines which secret provider to use and what secrets to retrieve. When pods requesting CSI volumes
are created, the CSI Secrets Store driver will send the request to the OpenBao CSI Provider if the provider
is `openbao`. The OpenBao CSI Provider will then use Secret Provider Class specified and the pod's service account to retrieve
the secrets from OpenBao, and mount them into the pod's CSI volume.

The secret is retrieved from OpenBao and populated to the CSI secrets store volume during the `ContainerCreation` phase.
This means that pods will be blocked from starting until the secrets have been read from OpenBao and written to the volume.

### Features

The following features are supported by the OpenBao CSI Provider:

- All OpenBao secret engines supported.
- Authentication using the requesting pod's service account.
- TLS/mTLS communications with OpenBao.
- Rendering OpenBao secrets to files.
- Dynamic lease caching and renewal performed by Agent.
- Syncing secrets to Kubernetes secrets to be used as environment variables.
- Installation via [OpenBao Helm](/docs/platform/k8s/helm)

## Authenticating with OpenBao

The OpenBao CSI Provider will authenticate with OpenBao as the service account of the
pod that mounts the CSI volume. [Kubernetes](/docs/auth/kubernetes) and
[JWT](/docs/auth/jwt) auth methods are supported. The pod's service account
must be bound to a OpenBao role and a policy granting access to the secrets desired.

It is highly recommended to run pods with dedicated Kubernetes service accounts to
ensure applications cannot access more secrets than they require.

## Secret provider class example

The following is an example of a Secret Provider Class using the `openbao` provider:

:::warning

`provider: openbao` only works starting with the OpenBao Helm Chart version 0.18.0, which uses the OpenBao CSI Provider version 2.0.0 or later.

:::

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: openbao-db-creds
spec:
  # OpenBao CSI Provider
  provider: openbao
  parameters:
    # OpenBao role name to use during login
    roleName: 'app'
    # OpenBao address and TLS connection config is normally best configured by the
    # helm chart, but can be overridden per SecretProviderClass:
    # OpenBao's hostname
    baoAddress: 'https://openbao:8200'
    # TLS CA certification for validation
    baoCACertPath: '/openbao/tls/ca.crt'
    objects: |
      - objectName: "dbUsername"
        secretPath: "database/creds/db-app"
        secretKey: "username"
      - objectName: "dbPassword"
        secretPath: "database/creds/db-app"
        secretKey: "password"
    # "objectName" is an alias used within the SecretProviderClass to reference
    # that specific secret. This will also be the filename containing the secret.
    # "secretPath" is the path in OpenBao where the secret should be retrieved.
    # "secretKey" is the key within the OpenBao secret response to extract a value from.
```

:::warning

Secret Provider Class is a namespaced object in Kubernetes.

## Using secret provider classes

An application pod uses the example Secret Provider Class above by mounting it as a CSI volume:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    app: demo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: app
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: my-app:1.0.0
          volumeMounts:
            - name: 'openbao-db-creds'
              mountPath: '/mnt/secrets-store'
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: openbao-db-creds
          csi:
            driver: 'secrets-store.csi.k8s.io'
            readOnly: true
            volumeAttributes:
              secretProviderClass: 'openbao-db-creds'
```

In this example `volumes.csi` is created on the application deployment and references
the Secret Provider Class named `openbao-db-creds`.
