# Autopilot

Autopilot enables automated workflows for managing Raft clusters. The current
feature set includes 3 main features: server stabilization, dead server cleanup
and state API.

## Server stabilization

Server stabilization helps to retain the stability of the Raft cluster by safely
joining new voting nodes to the cluster. When a new voter node is joined to an
existing cluster, Autopilot adds it as a non-voter instead, and waits for a
pre-configured amount of time to monitor it's health. If the node remains to be
healthy for the entire duration of stabilization, then that node will be
promoted as a voter. The server stabilization period can be tuned using
`server_stabilization_time` (see below).

## Dead server cleanup

Dead server cleanup automatically removes nodes deemed unhealthy from the
Raft cluster, avoiding the manual operator intervention. This feature can be
tuned using the `cleanup_dead_servers`, `dead_server_last_contact_threshold`,
and `min_quorum` (see below).

## State API

State API provides detailed information about all the nodes in the Raft cluster
in a single call. This API can be used for monitoring cluster health.

### Follower health

Follower node health is determined by 2 factors.

- Its ability to heartbeat to the leader node at regular intervals. Tuned using
  `last_contact_threshold` (see below).
- Its ability to keep up with data replication from the leader node. Tuned using
  `max_trailing_logs` (see below).

### Default configuration

By default, Autopilot is enabled in OpenBao, although dead server cleanup is not
enabled by default.

Autopilot exposes a [configuration
API](/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot#set-configuration) to manage its
behavior. Autopilot gets initialized with the following default values. If these
default values do not meet your expected Autopilot behavior, don't forget to set
them to your desired values.

- `cleanup_dead_servers` - `false`
  - This controls whether dead servers are removed from
    the Raft peer list periodically or when a new server joins. This requires that
    `min-quorum` is also set.

- `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` - `24h`
  - Limit on the amount of time
    a server can go without leader contact before being considered failed. This
    takes effect only when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set to `true`.

- `min_quorum` - This doesn't default to anything and should be set to the expected
  number of voters in your cluster when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set as `true`.
  - Minimum number of servers that should always be present in a cluster.
  Autopilot will not prune servers below this number.

- `max_trailing_logs` - `1000`
  - Amount of entries in the Raft Log that a server
    can be behind before being considered unhealthy.

- `last_contact_threshold` - `10s`
  - Limit on the amount of time a server can go without leader contact before being considered unhealthy.

- `server_stabilization_time` - `10s`
  - Minimum amount of time a server must be in a healthy state before it can become a voter. Until that happens,
    it will be visible as a peer in the cluster, but as a non-voter, meaning it won't contribute to quorum.

:::warning

**Note**: Autopilot in OpenBao does similar things to what autopilot does in
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/). However, the configuration in these 2 systems
differ in terms of default values and thresholds; some additional parameters
might also show up in OpenBao in comparison to Consul as well. Autopilot in OpenBao
and Consul use different technical underpinnings requiring these differences, to
provide the autopilot functionality.
