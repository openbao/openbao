# Architecture

OpenBao is an intricate system with numerous distinct components. This page details the system architecture and hopes to assist OpenBao users and developers to build a mental model while understanding the theory of operation.

# High-Level overview

The diagram below illustrates the intricacies and distinct components of OpenBao.

[![Architecture Overview](/img/layers.png)](/img/layers.png)

OpenBao’s encryption layer, referred to as the _barrier_, is responsible for encrypting and decrypting OpenBao data. When the OpenBao server starts, it writes data to its storage backend. Since the storage backend resides outside the barrier, it’s considered untrusted so OpenBao will encrypt the data before it sends them to the storage backend. This mechanism ensures that if a malicious attacker attempts to gain access to the storage backend, the data cannot be compromised since it remains encrypted, until OpenBao decrypts the data. The storage backend provides a durable data persistent layer where data is secured and available across server restarts.

When an OpenBao server is started, it begins in a _sealed_ state. Before any
operation can be performed on OpenBao, it must be _unsealed_. This is done by
providing the unseal keys. During the OpenBao initialization, it generates an
encryption key, which is used to protect all OpenBao data. This key is protected by
a root key that is stored alongside all other OpenBao data, but is encrypted by another mechanism: the unseal key.

By default, OpenBao uses [Shamir's Secret
Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) to split the
unseal key into a configured number of shards (key shares or unseal
keys). A precise number of shards are required to reconstruct the unseal key,
which is then used to decrypt the OpenBao's root key.

Refer to the [Seal/Unseal](../concepts/seal.mdx#seal-unseal) documentation for
further details.

The number of shares and the minimum number of shards required can both be specified.
Shamir's technique can be disabled, and the root key can be used directly for
unsealing. Once OpenBao retrieves the encryption key, it decrypts the
data in the storage backend, and enters the _unsealed_ state. Once unsealed,
OpenBao loads the configured audit devices, auth methods, and secrets
engines.

:::warning

**Note:** The default OpenBao configuration uses a Shamir seal; however, OpenBao can be [auto
unsealed](../concepts/seal.mdx#auto-unseal) by a trusted cloud key management
system (KMS) or hardware security module (HSM) to increase security.

The configuration of the audit devices, auth methods, and secrets engines are security sensitive and are stored in OpenBao. Users with permissions can modify them and cannot be specified outside of the barrier. By storing them in OpenBao, changes are protected by the ACL system and tracked by audit logs.

Requests may be processed from the HTTP API to the core once OpenBao is unsealed.
The core manages the flow of requests through the system,
enforce ACLs, and ensure audit logging is done.

When a client first connects to OpenBao, the client needs to authenticate. OpenBao provides
configurable auth methods and offers flexibility within the authentication mechanism
used. Mechanisms such as username/password or GitHub may be
used for operators, while applications may use public/private keys or tokens to
authenticate. An authentication request that flows through the core and into an auth
method determines if the request is valid and returns a list of
associated policies.

Policies are just a named ACL rule. For example, the "root" policy is built-in
and permits access to all resources. You may create any number of named policies
with fine-grained control over paths. OpenBao operates in an allowed-access mode, meaning the action is not allowed unless access is granted via a policy explicitly. Since a user may have multiple policies associated, actions are allowed when policy permits. Policies are stored and managed by an internal
policy store. This internal store is affected through the system backend,
which is always mounted at `sys/`.

Once authentication takes place and an auth method provides a set of applicable
policies, a new client token is generated and managed by the token store. This
client token is used to make future requests.
This token method is similar to a cookie sent by a website when a user logs in. Depending on the auth method configuration, the client
token may have a lease associated with it, and may need to be renewed periodically to avoid invalidation.

Once authenticated, requests are made by providing the client token. The client token is
used to verify the client, ensuring they are authorized while loading the relevant policies. The
policies are used to authorize the client request. The request is then routed to the secrets engine, which is processed depending on its type. When the secrets engine returns the secret, the core registers it with the expiration manager and attaches a lease ID.  Clients use the lease ID to renew or revoke their
secret. The expiration manager automatically revokes the secret if a client allows the lease to expire.

The core logs requests and responses to the audit broker, distributing the requests to all configured audit devices. Outside of the request
flow, the core performs specific background activities. Lease management is critical, allowing expired client tokens or secrets to be revoked automatically. Additionally, OpenBao handles specific partial-failure cases by using write-ahead logging with a rollback manager. This is managed transparently within the core and is not user-visible.
