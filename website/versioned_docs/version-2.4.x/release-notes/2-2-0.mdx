# OpenBao 2.2.x release notes

:::tip

The v2.2.x release series is the first with Web UI support!

:::

## 2.2.2
**Release date:** May 29, 2025

### SECURITY:

* sdk/framework: prevent information disclosure on invalid request. HCSEC-2025-09 / CVE-2025-4166. [[GH-1323](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1323)]

### BUG FIXES:

* ui: Fix description of Organizational Unit (OU) field in PKI. [[GH-1333](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1333)]

## 2.2.1
**Release date:** April 22, 2025

### BUG FIXES

* cli: Return a quoted string URL when -output-curl-string flag is passed in [[GH-1038](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1038)]
* openbao: update modules and checksums to address vulnerabilities [[GH-1126](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1126)]
* secrets/pki: Remove null value for subproblems encoding, fixing compatibility with certain ACME clients like certbot. [[GH-1236](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1236)]

## 2.2.0
**Release date:** March 5, 2025

### CHANGES

* command/server: Prevent and warn about loading of duplicate config file from config directory. [[GH-816](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/816)]
* container: Set -dev-no-store-token in default container images, fixing default read-only containers. [[GH-826](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/826)]
* core/seal: remove support for legacy pre-keyring barrier entries
core/seal: remove support for legacy (direct) shamir unseal keys [[GH-750](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/750)]
* core: Remove support for Solaris due to lack of Docker support. [[GH-710](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/710)]

### FEATURES

* **ACME TLS Listener Certificate Provisioning**: Automatically fetch TLS certificates for OpenBao Server's TCP listeners via an Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME - RFC 8555) capable certificate authority (CA). This allows OpenBao to be self-hosted, using a CA contained within the instance to sign the instance's own certificates. [[GH-857](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/857)]
* **PKCS#11 Auto-Unseal**: Add support for automatic unsealing of OpenBao using a PKCS#11-enabled Hardware Security Module (HSM) or Key Management System (KMS). [[GH-889](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/889)]
* **Scanning**: introduce the ability to recursively list (scan) within plugins, adding a separate `scan` ACL capability, operation type, HTTP verb (`SCAN` with `GET` fallback via `?scan=true`), API, and CLI support. This also adds support to the KVv1 and KVv2 engines. [[GH-763](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/763)]
* **Transit**: Add support for key derivation mechanisms (derives a new key from a base key).
   - This path uses the named base key and derivation algorithm specific parameters to derive a new named key.
   - Currently, only the ECDH key agreement algorithm is supported: the base key is one's own ECC private key and the "peer_public_key" is the pem-encoded other party's ECC public key.The computed shared secret is the resulting derived key. [[GH-811](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/811)]
* **UI**: Reintroduction of the WebUI. [[GH-940](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/940)]
* raft: Added support for nodes to join the Raft cluster as non-voters. [[GH-741](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/741)]

### IMPROVEMENTS

* audit: modify the hashWalker to handle nested structs without panicing [[GH-887](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/887)]
* auth: Use transactions for read-then-write methods in the credential package [[GH-952](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/952)]
* auth: Use transactions for write and delete config for various auth methods. [[GH-878](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/878)]
* core/mounts: Allow tuning HMAC request and response parameters on sys/, cubbyhole/, and identity/, enabling auditing of core policy changes. [[GH-921](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/921)]
* core/policies: Allow listing policies under a given prefix. [[GH-736](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/736)]
* core/policies: add `pagination_limit` to ACL policies for enforcing max pagination sizes. [[GH-802](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/802)]
* core: Bump to latest Go toolchain 1.24.0. [[GH-1000](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1000)]
* identity: return alias metadata when listing entity aliases [[GH-1013](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1013)]
* rabbitmq: Use transactions for read-then-write methods in the rabbitmq package [[GH-997](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/997)]
* secret/pki: Add new endpoint `pki/certs/detailed` to return detailed cert list. [[GH-680](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/680)]
* secret/pki: Add pagination to `tidy` operations for improved scalability in large certificate stores. [[GH-678](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/678)]
* secrets/kv: add a `detailed-metadata/:prefix` endpoint that supports listing entries along with their corresponding metadata in the detailed key_info response field [[GH-766](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/766)]
* transit: Use transactions for read + write policy operations [[GH-956](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/956)]
* ui: Remove client count menu [[GH-734](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/734)]

### BUG FIXES

* core-listener: Fix operator diagnose with unix-socker listener [[GH-958](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/958)]
* raft: Fix noisy warn on follower-less keyring rotation. [[GH-937](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/937)]
* secrets/pki: Fix bao pki health-check detection on non-pki mounts. [[GH-935](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/935)]
* ui: fix missing checkmarks in all checkboxes, due to invalid use of sass-svg-uri package [[GH-1042](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1042)]
