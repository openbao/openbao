# Ecosystem

OpenBao has a large and active Ecosystem. This does not only include our
Developers and Maintainers, but also users, who test new features and report
issues and other software that integrates with OpenBao. More broadly, we
categorize our ecosystem into the following categories:

- [**Supporters:**](./supporters) companies, individuals or other entities who
  actively sponsor the development of OpenBao, either via direct code or
  documentation contributions or indirectly via financial support or gifting
  premium features on their platforms.
- [**Integrators:**](./integrators) Projects / Technologies which integrate or
  make use of OpenBao.
- [**Adopters:**](./adopters) organizations which run and use OpenBao.
- [**Vendors:**](./vendors) organizations which provide professional services
  for OpenBao. For example offer consulting or managed OpenBao instances.

These categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, most Supporters will
also be Integrators, Adopters, or Vendors.

If you or your organization are missing, please [suggest the
addition](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/new?template=docs_ecosystem.md).
