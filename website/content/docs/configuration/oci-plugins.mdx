  OpenBao server configuration reference for OCI plugin parameters.

# OCI plugins

OpenBao supports the distribution of plugins in Open Container Initiative (OCI)
images. Operators can define the desired plugins for their OpenBao cluster
directly in the server configuration files. On startup, OpenBao will check for
locally cached binaries, verify their integrity, and only download and extract
new or updated plugin binaries from the specified OCI images if necessary. This
approach uses existing container ecosystem tooling and infrastructure for
robust, secure, and efficient plugin management.

Making use of OCI based plugins provides a number of advantages over manually
managing the plugin binaries:

  * **Automated Discovery and Installation:** Operators can define the used
    plugins in code and OpenBao will automatically download and extract them
    during startup.
  * **Integrity Verification:**  When extracting plugin binaries from OCI images
    OpenBao ensures the SHA256 sum of the extracted binary is the same as in the
    configuration files.
  * **Version Management:** Distributing new a new version of a plugin just
    requires an update of the configuration file instead of manually placing the
    binary on every node.
  * **Supply Chain Security:** Using OCI registries for plugin distribution
    allows operators to make use of the registries security features like
    authentication, vulnerability scanning and immutable storage.
 
## `plugins`

The `plugins` block defines OCI-based plugins to download.

```hcl
plugins {
  "plugin-name" {
    url         = "registry.example.com/org/plugin:tag"
    binary_name = "plugin-binary-name"  
    sha256sum   = "sha256-checksum"
  }
}
```

### Parameters

- `url` `(string: required)` - Full OCI image URL including registry, repository, and tag.

- `binary_name` `(string: required)` - Name of the plugin binary file within the OCI image.

- `sha256sum` `(string: required)` - Expected SHA256 checksum of the plugin binary. Must be a 64-character hexadecimal string.

### Example

```hcl
plugins {
  "secrets-aws" {
    url         = "ghcr.io/openbao/openbao-plugin-secrets-aws:v1.0.0"
    binary_name = "openbao-plugin-secrets-aws"
    sha256sum   = "9fdd8be7947e4a4caf7cce4f0e02695081b6c85178aa912df5d37be97363144c"
  }
}
```

## `plugin_download_behavior`

Controls server behavior when plugin downloads fail.

```hcl
plugin_download_behavior = "fail"
```

### Values

- `"fail"` `(default)` - Server startup fails if any plugin download fails
- `"warn"` - Log warnings for failed downloads but continue startup

## Authentication

When downloading plugin images from a private registry, OpenBao will use
credentials as described in the Docker or Podman configuration files present on
the system in the following order:

1. `~/.docker/config.json` or `%USERPROFILE%\.docker\config.json` on Windows.
2. A `config.json` file in the directory specified in the `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. The path specified by the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable.
4. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`

:::tip

When deploying OpenBao to Kubernetes you can mount an Image Pull Secret into the
Pods to use for authentication.

## Complete example

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path = "/opt/openbao/data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8200"
}

plugin_directory = "/opt/openbao/plugins"
plugin_download_behavior = "fail"

plugins {
  "secrets-aws" {
    url         = "ghcr.io/openbao/openbao-plugin-secrets-aws:v1.0.0"
    binary_name = "openbao-plugin-secrets-aws"
    sha256sum   = "9fdd8be7947e4a4caf7cce4f0e02695081b6c85178aa912df5d37be97363144c"
  }
}
```

## OCI image requirements

OpenBao requires the plugin binary to be present in the image's root directory.
It is also advised to make use of a static Go binary to not run into any libc
issues.

### Example Containerfile

```
FROM scratch
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source=https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugins

COPY bin/openbao-plugin-auth-aws_linux_amd64* openbao-plugin-auth-aws

ENTRYPOINT ["/openbao-plugin-auth-aws"]
```
