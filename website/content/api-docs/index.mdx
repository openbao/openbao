# HTTP API

The OpenBao HTTP API gives you full access to OpenBao using [REST like HTTP verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Every aspect of OpenBao can be controlled using the APIs. The OpenBao CLI uses the
HTTP API to access OpenBao similar to all other consumers.

All API routes are prefixed with `/v1/`.

This documentation is only for the v1 API, which is currently the only version.

:::warning

**Backwards compatibility:** At the current version, OpenBao does not yet
promise backwards compatibility even with the v1 prefix. We'll remove this
warning when this policy changes. At this point in time the core API (that
is, `sys/` routes) change very infrequently, but various secrets engines/auth
methods/etc. sometimes have minor changes to accommodate new features as
they're developed.

:::

## Transport

The API is expected to be accessed over a TLS connection at all times, with a
valid certificate that is verified by a well-behaved client. It is possible to
disable TLS verification for listeners, however, so API clients should expect
to have to do both depending on user settings.

## Authentication

Once OpenBao is unsealed, almost every other operation requires a _client token_.
A user may have a client token sent to them. The client token must be sent as
either the `X-Vault-Token` HTTP Header or as `Authorization` HTTP Header using
the `Bearer <token>` scheme.

Otherwise, a client token can be retrieved using an [authentication
engine](/docs/auth).

Each auth method has one or more unauthenticated login endpoints. These
endpoints can be reached without any authentication, and are used for
authentication to OpenBao itself. These endpoints are specific to each auth
method.

Responses from auth login methods that generate an authentication token are
sent back to the client in JSON. The resulting token should be saved on the
client or passed via the `X-Vault-Token` or `Authorization` header for future requests.

## Parameter restrictions

Several OpenBao APIs require specifying path parameters. The path parameter cannot end
in periods. Otherwise, OpenBao will return a 404 unsupported path error.

## API operations

Typically the request data, body and response data to and from OpenBao is in JSON.
OpenBao sets the `Content-Type` header appropriately with its response and does
not require it from the clients request.

The demonstration below uses the [`KVv1` secrets engine](secret/kv/kv-v1.mdx), which is a
simple Key/Value store. Please read [the API documentation of KV secret engines](secret/kv/index.mdx)
for details of `KVv1` compared to `KVv2` and how they differ in their URI paths
as well as the features available in version 2 of the KV secrets engine.

For `KVv1`, reading a secret using the HTTP API is done by issuing a GET:

```text
/v1/secret/foo
```

This maps to `secret/foo` where `foo` is the key in the `secret/` mount, which
is mounted by default on a fresh OpenBao install and is of type `kv`.

Here is an example of reading a secret using cURL:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    -X GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/foo
```

A few endpoints consume calls with `GET` query string parameters, but only if
those parameters are not sensitive, especially since  some load balancers will
be able log these. Most endpoints that accept `POST` query string parameters
expect those parameters in the request body.

You can list secrets as well. To do this, either issue a `GET` with the query
string parameter `list=true`, or you use the `LIST` HTTP verb. For the `kv` secrets
engine, listing is allowed on directories only, which returns the keys at the
requested path:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    -X LIST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/
```

The API documentation uses `LIST` as the HTTP verb, but you can still use `GET`
with the `?list=true` query string.

To make an API with specific data in request body, issue a `POST`:

```text
/v1/secret/foo
```

with a JSON body like:

```javascript
{
  "value": "bar"
}
```

Here is an example of writing a secret using cURL:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"data":{"value":"bar"}}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/baz
```

OpenBao currently considers `PUT` and `POST` to be synonyms. Rather than trust a
client's stated intentions, OpenBao engines can implement an existence check to
discover whether an operation is actually a create or update operation based on
the data already stored within OpenBao. This makes permission management via ACLs
more flexible.

A [KVv2 example](secret/kv/kv-v2.mdx#sample-request-3) for the engine path of `secret` requires that URI is
appended with ***`data/`***  prior to the secret name (`baz`) such as:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"data":{"value":"bar"}}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/baz
```

For more examples, please look at the OpenBao API client.

## The `X-Vault-Request` header

Requests that are sent to a [OpenBao Proxy][proxy] that is configured to use the
`require_request_header` option must include the `X-Vault-Request` header
entry, e.g.:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    -H "X-Vault-Request: true" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"value":"bar"}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/baz
```

The OpenBao CLI always adds this header to every request, regardless of whether
the request is being sent to an OpenBao Agent or directly to an OpenBao Server. In
addition, the OpenBao SDK always adds this header to every request.

## Help

To retrieve the help for any API within OpenBao, including mounted engines, auth
methods, etc. then append `?help=1` to any URL. If you have valid permission to
access the path, then the help text will be returned as a markdown-formatted block
in the `help` attribute of the response.

Additionally, with the [OpenAPI generation](system/internal-specs-openapi.mdx) in OpenBao, you will get back a small
OpenAPI document in the `openapi` attribute. This document is relevant for the
path you're looking up and any paths under it - also note paths in the OpenAPI
document are relative to the initial path queried.


Example request:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    -H "X-Vault-Token: f3b09679-3001-009d-2b80-9c306ab81aa6" \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret?help=1
```

Example response:

```javascript

## Error response

A common JSON structure is always returned to return errors:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    "message",
    "another message"
  ]
}
```

This structure will be returned for any HTTP status greater than or equal to 400.

## HTTP status codes

The following HTTP status codes are used throughout the API. OpenBao tries to
adhere to these whenever possible, but in case it doesn't -- then feel free to
[raise a bug](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues) for our attention!

:::warning

_Note_: Applications should be prepared to accept both `200` and `204` as
success. `204` is simply an indication that there is no response body to parse,
but API endpoints that indicate that they return a `204` may return a `200` if
warnings are generated during the operation.

:::

- `200` - Success with data.
- `204` - Success, no data returned.
- `400` - Invalid request, missing or invalid data.
- `403` - Forbidden, your authentication details are either incorrect, you
  don't have access to this feature, or - if CORS is enabled - you made a
  cross-origin request from an origin that is not allowed to make such
  requests.
- `404` - Invalid path. This can both mean that the path truly doesn't exist or
  that you don't have permission to view a specific path. We use 404 in some
  cases to avoid state leakage.

:::info

**Note**: 404 is also returned on `LIST` endpoints with no results.

:::

- `405` - Unsupported operation.  You tried to use a method inappropriate to
  the request path, e.g. a POST on an endpoint that only accepts GETs.
- `429` - Default return code for health status of standby nodes. This will
  likely change in the future.
- `500` - Internal server error. An internal error has occurred, try again
  later. If the error persists, report a bug.
- `502` - A request to OpenBao required OpenBao making a request to a third party;
  the third party responded with an error of some kind.
- `503` - OpenBao is down for maintenance or is currently sealed. Try again
  later.

## Limits

A maximum request size of 32MB is imposed to prevent a denial of service attack
with arbitrarily large requests; this can be tuned per `listener` block in
OpenBao's server configuration file.
