![Meet OpenBao at OSS Europe 2025](/img/ossummit_meet_bao.png)

Open source builders, security engineers, and platform teams are converging on Amsterdam and OpenBao will be in the middle of it, thanks to the generosity of the Linux Foundation.

We’re excited to announce our first official booth at **[Open Source Summit Europe 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/)**. If you care about secure automation, multi‑tenant architectures, or meeting the stewards of your critical infrastructure tooling, come talk with us!

Official event site: [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/)

**Find Us**  
Event: Open Source Summit Europe 2025  
Dates: 25–27 August 2025  
Location: RAI Amsterdam, Netherlands  
Booth: `G/S7`  
Hashtag: `#OSSummit` `#OpenBao`  

This isn’t just a swag stop (expect some stickers); it’s a place to trade real-world stories, get practical guidance, and influence the [OpenBao roadmap](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/569), now ready for its second iteration!

## What You’ll Get at the Booth

**Guided Walkthroughs** – We’ll walk you through the latest capabilities: Namespaces, advanced policy handling, paginated lists, and more... Ask deep architectural questions (scaling, HSM integrations, and migration strategies) and get answers from the people writing the code.

**Deployment & Design Q&A** – Are you architecting resilient deployments, tightening policy boundaries, or integrating with existing PKI or signing workflows? Bring real problems, leave with practical next steps.

**Roadmap Preview** – Near‑term energy: safer ops (policy and audit hygiene), resilience (parallel and namespace unseal), practical scalability (standby node read request handling). Bigger ecosystem/registry ideas come later. Tell us what you need most!

**Community Meetups** – Connect with maintainers, contributors, downstream integrators, and fellow operators. Hallway conversations around pain points often become features.

**Contribution Guidance** – Want to help? We’ll highlight good first issues, active design discussions, and how to start, whether you're an experienced developer new to Open Source, someone looking to get into technical writing, or anything in between!

## Why It Matters

OpenBao represents a community‑first, transparently governed evolution in secrets management. No lock‑in. No unclear licensing pivots. Just open, auditable, extensible security primitives stewarded in the open. Our presence at OSS Europe marks a milestone in maturity—and a recommitment to collaborative innovation.

## Who Should Stop By?

- OSPS leadership looking to understand viable alternatives to their company's vendor lock-in problems
- Platform & DevSecOps teams standardizing secret workflows
- Security engineers evaluating trust, provenance, and lifecycle controls
- Architects designing regulated or multi‑tenant environments
- Contributors (or future ones) curious where to jump in
- Anyone comparing OpenBao with legacy or closed models

## Key Themes We’ll Be Talking About

- Secure multi‑tenancy with Namespaces
- Operational trust: auditing, rotation, lifecycle management
- Plugin & ecosystem growth
- Secrets management at scale
- Community governance & sustainability

## Engage Before / During / After

- Plan Your Visit: Add our booth to your event schedule (check the published schedule once live).
- Register: Early reg & travel info via the event site’s [registration page](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/register/).
- Follow Along: [openbao.org](https://openbao.org) & our LinkedIn page ([OpenBao on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openbao)) for micro‑updates and drop‑in session times.
- Ask Early: Have a thorny problem? Post it in advance in community channels so we can prep a live walkthrough.
- Remote? We’ll share recaps, photos, and key takeaways using `#OSSummit` and `#OpenBao`.

## Call to Action

Show up. Challenge us. Tell us what you need from the next generation of open‑source secrets management, and help build and shape it. OpenBao moves fastest when the community is loud.

See you in Amsterdam!
