The OpenBao community had a great time at **[Open Source Summit Europe 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/)**! The event once again showed how strong the demand for secure and reliable secret management in enterprise environments has become.

One theme was clear: Companies and individuals demand tools to manage secrets across their systems, and solutions like OpenBao are foundational for security and compliance.

Together with the Team from RISC-V and DeepComputing we were able to successfully test our riscv64 binaries on a DeepComputing DC-ROMA RISC-V laptop. With our added RISC-V support in [PR #168](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/168) this was super easy and just worked out of the box.

Throughout the conference, we shared how OpenBao is able to help organizations to run production workloads securely. We showcased existing features such as strong encryption, fine-grained access controls and namespace isolation. We also gave a glimpse into whatâ€™s next: declarative initialization, improvements around namespaces and extended key management capabilities.

Furthermore, the conference was also a wonderful opportunity for OpenBao maintainers to meet in person, exchange ideas, and align on next steps. A big thank you goes to [**Adfinis**](https://adfinis.com/), [**Paymenttools**](https://www.paymenttools.com/) and [**Reply**](https://www.reply.com/), who supported the project by sending maintainers to represent OpenBao on-site.

And finally, a heartfelt thanks to everyone who stopped by, joined discussions, or offered feedback. Your energy and curiosity keep the project moving forward. To everyone who was not able to join the conference, feel free to learn more at [**openbao.org**](https://openbao.org/docs/contributing/) or join the conversation on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/openbao).
