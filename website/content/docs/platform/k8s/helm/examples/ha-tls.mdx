# HA Cluster with Raft and TLS

The overview for [Integrated Storage and
TLS](../../../../concepts/integrated-storage/index.mdx#integrated-storage-and-tls) covers
the various options for mitigating TLS verification warnings and bootstrapping
your Raft cluster.

Without proper configuration, you will see the following warning before cluster
initialization:
```shell
core: join attempt failed: error="error during raft bootstrap init call: Put "https://openbao-${N}.${SERVICE}:8200/v1/sys/storage/raft/bootstrap/challenge": x509: certificate is valid for ${SERVICE}, ${SERVICE}.${NAMESPACE}, ${SERVICE}.${NAMESPACE}.svc, ${SERVICE}.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local, not openbao-${N}.${SERVICE}"
```

The examples below demonstrate two specific solutions. Both solutions ensure
that the common name (CN) used for the `leader_api_addr` in the Raft stanza
matches the name(s) listed in the TLS certificate.

## Before you start

1. Follow the steps from the example [HA OpenBao Cluster with Integrated
Storage](ha-with-raft.mdx) to build the cluster.

2. Follow the examples and instructions in [Standalone Server with
TLS](standalone-tls.mdx) to create a TLS
certificate.

## Solution 1: Use auto-join and set the TLS server in your Raft configuration

The join warning disappears if you use auto-join and set the expected TLS
server name (`${CN}`) with
[`leader_tls_servername`](../../../../configuration/storage/raft.mdx#leader_tls_servername)
in the Raft stanza for your OpenBao configuration.

For example:

```hcl {6,14,22}
storage "raft" {
  path = "/openbao/data"

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "https://openbao-0.${SERVICE}:8200"
    leader_tls_servername = "${CN}"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.crt"
    leader_client_key_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.key"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.ca"
  }

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "https://openbao-1.${SERVICE}:8200"
    leader_tls_servername = "${CN}"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.crt"
    leader_client_key_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.key"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.ca"
  }

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "https://openbao-2.${SERVICE}:8200"
    leader_tls_servername = "${CN}"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.crt"
    leader_client_key_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.key"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.ca"
  }
}
```

## Solution 2:  Add a load balancer to your Raft configuration

If you have a load balancer for your OpenBao cluster, you can add a single
`retry_join` stanza to your Raft configuration and use the load balancer
address for `leader_api_addr`.

For example:

```hcl {5}
storage "raft" {
  path = "/openbao/data"

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "https://openbao-active:8200"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.crt"
    leader_client_key_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.key"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/openbao/tls/openbao.ca"
  }
}
```
