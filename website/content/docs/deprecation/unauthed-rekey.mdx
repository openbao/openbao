# Deprecating Unauthenticated Rekey Endpoints

## What

In OpenBao v2.4.0, the `disable_unauthed_rekey_endpoints` parameter will be
set to `true` by default (currently `false`), preventing all requests to the
unauthenticated `sys/rekey/*` and `sys/rekey-recovery-key/*` endpoints.

A replacement will be made available ahead of this change landing.

## Why

These endpoints pose a security risk. An unauthenticated attacker may call
the cancel endpoint (`DELETE /sys/rekey/init` or
`DELETE /sys/rekey-recovery-key/init`), interrupting a valid rekey operation.
Additionally, an attacker may choose to initiate their own rekey operation.

Such interaction is not audited and may not result in log messages.

A log line such as:

```
2025-05-12T14:59:20.819-0500 [INFO]  core: rekey initialized: nonce=592d7982-47aa-b8c9-3d72-b37db72e389f shares=1 threshold=1 validation_required=false
```

may be visible if an attacker initiated their own rekey operation; this
operation would not be successful.
