# OpenBao proxy persistent caching

OpenBao Proxy can restore tokens and leases from a persistent cache file created
by a previous OpenBao Proxy process. The persistent cache is a BoltDB file that
includes tuples encrypted by a generated encryption key. The encrypted tuples
include the OpenBao token used to retrieve secrets, leases for tokens/secrets, and
secret values.

:::info

**Note:** OpenBao Proxy Persistent Caching will only restore _leased_
secrets. Secrets that are not renewable, such as KV v2, will not be persisted.

:::

In order to use OpenBao Proxy persistent cache, auto-auth must be used. If the
auto-auth token has expired by the time the cache is restored, the cache will
be invalidated and secrets will need to be re-fetched from OpenBao.

:::info

**Note** OpenBao Proxy persistent cache is currently supported only in a
Kubernetes environment.
