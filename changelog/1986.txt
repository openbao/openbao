```release-note:feature
Support **Horizontal Read Scalability**: all existing HA standby nodes are automatically upgraded with read support.
  - Requests which only perform storage read operations will be handled locally on the standby node.
  - Requests which perform a storage write operation (or as indicated by plugins) are forwarded to the active leader.
  - Results are eventually consistent: a write may not be immediately visible on the standby.
  - To disable, set `disable_standby_reads=true` in the config file before startup.
```
