# Support control groups for authorizing paths

## Summary

This feature would implement second-party authorization for protected
resources. A control-group restriction placed on a path would require
a user to obtain prior authorization before the action would succeed.

Using the control group feature would follow this general pattern, via API
endpoints:

1. A path is assigned a control-group policy
2. Access to the path is denied without control group authorization
3. A user belonging to the control group can authorize the resource for a particular entity
4. Access to the path is now permitted to the authorized entity

A second phase might add a request/notification workflow, but this is not essential:
1. A user requests access to the protected resource
2. Members of the control group receive a notification of the request
3. The original user receives notification of the control group approval when it occurs

## Problem Statement

The problem is as follows. An organization wants to review access to
certain secrets (eg, pki issuance, etc) on a case-by-case basis. A
directory group-membership will indicate who the reviewers are. They
should be able grant access by endpoint. They should not be able to
review their own requests.

## User-facing Description

## Technical Description

Several techniques might be possible for implementation

## Rationale and Alternatives

This is essentially "assigning a policy to a resource and a user"
which allows some level of access -- something we can already do in
OpenBao. The control group, essentially, is an OpenBao administrator
assigning policies. However, the control-group idea has some
additional value:

1. The administrator can specify a delegate group, any member of which can approve
2. Inhibiting self-approval can ensure "second set of eyes"
3. Simplified workflow when added
