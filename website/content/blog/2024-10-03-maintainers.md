\o Hello OpenBao community!

In our last [community post](/blog/kickoff/), we said:

> **Join the community and its leadership today.**

But you said: _it is not clear how!_

Good news: Our community roles are [approved and live](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#openbao-community-roles)!

<!-- truncate -->

## How were the community roles created?

Open discussions on what roles should exist in the community started [early in the community's history](https://github.com/orgs/openbao/discussions/228). Eventually, I put forward [a proposal](https://lists.openssf.org/g/openbao/topic/proposal_community/108163995) for review [by the community](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/15211863/OpenBao+Meetings) (on August 29th, 2024) and with the support of the [TSC](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/15212291/2024-08-08+OpenBao+TSC+Meeting). This was adopted officially on September 30th, 2024 thanks to unanimous votes [by the TSC](https://lists.openssf.org/g/OpenBao-TSC/topic/announce_roadmap/108738128)!

## What are our community roles?

The accepted proposal [introduced three roles](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#overview), open for anyone, regardless of employer, to apply:

1. Org-wide [**Moderators**](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#organization-level-moderators-1), to help triage issues and pull requests across all of our repositories.
2. Repository [**Committers**](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#repository-level-committers), to help maintain specific plugins, libraries, or portions of the core.
3. Org-wide [**Maintainers**](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#organization-level-maintainers-1), which are given broader permissions across all repositories and are automatically voting members of the Dev WG.

These roles have _increasing barriers to entry_: being a security-sensitive project, we need to balance our desire for open governance with an adequate vetting process for contributing.

## How do I apply?

When eligibility requirements are met, application is usually as simple as collecting some evidence and accomplishments in the community and sending an email to [the mailing list](https://lists.openssf.org/g/openbao)! Then a relevant body of contributors will vote on applicants.

## Why is this important?

A project defining its own governance is an important step along the [project maturity process](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LE/pages/15848760/Project+Stages+Definitions+and+Expectations).

But more than that, OpenBao is an open-source project under open-governance. Unlike HashiCorp's [Core Contributors](https://www.credly.com/org/hashicorp/badge/hashicorp-core-contributor-2024) _award_, these positions can give community members _maintainer_ access to OpenBao repositories, something HashiCorp never allowed non-employees to have. Achieving organization-level maintainer allows you a vote on the Development Working Group and passing a vote by the TSC is a testament to the impact of your work. It gives you, the contributor, a voice in this project's leadership. And increasing the diversity and preventing a monoculture by a single employer is what will help make this experiment succeed.

## What's next for OpenBao?

Glad you asked! Next up is ratifying the [Development Working Group charter](https://gist.github.com/cipherboy/f6fc1f970f9c5feb753e2dd58e145eff) and defining how one [joins the TSC](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/62586881/2024-10-10+OpenBao+TSC+Meeting). These two documents are the last key pieces of governance our community needs to define as it works towards stage 2 in the LF Edge project maturity model.
