# Code organization

OpenBao repository is organized into five main modules:

 - An API client ([in `api/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/api))
   for interacting with OpenBao instances,
 - A collection of useful helper modules
   ([in `sdk/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/)),
 - The Web UI, built with Ember and [temporarily disabled](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/189)
   ([in `ui/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/ui/)),
 - The API and documentation website ([in `website/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/website/)), and
 - The cli and server code, [everywhere else](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/).

Of these, `api/` and `sdk/` are separate Go modules meant to be importable
into other applications. The Go module in the root of the project is for
the server and is not meant to be externally importable.

## API

The included API is a bespoke API client written in Go. Because this is
expected to be stable, we need to carefully consider whether a change will be
breaking to consumers of the library. Some key files are:

 - [`api/client.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/api/client.go) is
   the main entry point of the client.
 - [`api/logical.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/api/logical.go) has
   backend-agnostic utilities for speaking OpenBao API semantics.
 - [`api/secret.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/api/secret.go) has
   structured response parsing.
 - [`api/auth`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/api/auth) has various
   specialized authentication plugin helpers.
 - [`api/sys_*.go`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopenbao%2Fopenbao%20api%2Fsys&type=code),
   [`api/kv*.go`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopenbao%2Fopenbao%20api%2Fkv&type=code),
   [`api/auth.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/api/auth.go), and
   [`api/ssh.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/api/ssh.go) have
   backend-specific calls for various portions of the API space (such as
   [`sys/`](/api-docs/system), authenticating to OpenBao, or the
   [`ssh` plugin](../secrets/ssh/index.mdx)).

Upstream also includes [OpenAPI-based client libraries](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/41)
that haven't yet been forked; if maintainers are interested in helping to
support these libraries, let us know!

## SDK

The SDK module exists to share externally usable, independent modules with
people outside of OpenBao. These may be things useful in conjunction with
OpenBao (e.g., [`sdk/plugin`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/plugin)
for building auth and secret plugins), they might be testing libraries
(such as [`sdk/helper/testcluster`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper/testcluster)
for testing plugins or external projects that rely on OpenBao from Go tests),
or they might be standalone libraries provided to the community (such as
[`sdk/helper/shamir/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper/shamir).

Each of these packages are different and serve a different goal; some commonly
used packages are:

 - [`sdk/framework/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/framework)
   contains various HTTP helpers such as typing and parsing for request parameters.
 - [`sdk/logical/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/logical)
   contains the type definitions for core and plugin interoperability, including
   requests, responses, and the underlying storage model.
 - [`sdk/plugin/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/plugin)
   contains the GRPC bindings for external auth and secret plugins.
 - [`sdk/database/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/database)
   contains the same bindings but for external database plugins.
 - [`sdk/physical/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/physical)
   contains the interface definition of a storage backend, including
   implementations of the File and InMemory non-production backends.
 - [`sdk/helper/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper)
   contains many external libraries. Some highlights are:
    - [`sdk/helper/shamir/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper/shamir)
      implements Shamir's secret sharing and has been moved for external
      consumption.
    - [`sdk/helper/certutil/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper/certutil)
      has leaf and CA certificate creation code used by the PKI engine and
      the database secrets engine.
    - [`sdk/helper/ocsp/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/sdk/helper/ocsp)
      contains an OCSP client utilized by the cert auth method, originally
      forked from Snowflake.

Note that the SDK has a loose breakage policy: while we aim to minimize
disruption, the SDK firstly serves OpenBao's server and thus will be updated
as requirements here change. As such, the SDK is versioned with a 0 major
version to indicate this potential lack of compatibility.

## UI

The Web UI is built with Ember.

## Website

The website is built [with Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and includes
two main sections:

 - [`api-docs`](/api-docs) a hand-maintained API reference to all endpoints
   in OpenBao.
 - [`docs`](/docs), for everything else, including information about
   [various](../secrets/index.mdx) [plugins](../auth/index.mdx), this
   [contributing guide](index.mdx), and [various](../policies/index.mdx)
   [decisions](../rfcs/index.mdx) made by the TSC and the OpenBao community.

To add a new page, create the `.mdx` file in the appropriate subfolder within
[`website/content`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/website/content/)
and then add the page to the sidebar (if the page is under `docs/`, then to
[`website/sidebars.ts`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/website/sidebars.ts)
else if the page is under `api-docs/`, then to
[`website/sidebarsApi.ts`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/website/sidebarsApi.ts)).

## OpenBao CLI, server, and plugins

The remaining code is for the OpenBao CLI, server, and a few built-in plugins.

At a high level, these directories are:

 - [`audit/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/audit/) contains
   interface definitions for auditing requests and responses.
 - [`builtin/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/builtin/) contains
   the builtin plugins:
   - [`builtin/audit/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/builtin/audit)
     contains the built-in audit backends such as [file](../audit/file.mdx) or
     [syslog](../audit/syslog.mdx).
   - [`builtin/credential/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/builtin/credential)
     contains the built-in authentication plugins such as
     [AppRole](../auth/approle.mdx) or [cert](../auth/cert.mdx).
   - [`builtin/logical/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/builtin/logical)
     contains the built-in secret engines such as
     [PKI](../secrets/pki/index.mdx) or [kv](../secrets/kv/index.mdx).
   - [`builtin/plugin/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/builtin/plugin)
     contains a source-agnostic plugin wrapper (either using the builtin
     plugin or handling the GRPC connection to an external plugin).
 - [`command/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/command/) contains
   the CLI interface definitions: each command is in a separate file connected
   through [`command/commands.go`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/command/commands.go).
   Many plugins reuse the same generic `read`, `write`, `list`, ... commands,
   but a few (like K/V or PKI) have plugin-specific commands. This also
   includes Agent, Proxy, and Server configuration parsing and startup code,
   though much of the functionality for the latter is elsewhere.
 - [`helper/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/helper/) includes
   various internal libraries useful only in the context of OpenBao.
 - [`http/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/http/) contains
   the main server code [creating](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/42e77de61c145aa768ada9c1883f570e76e8708e/http/handler.go#L130-L132)
   the [http.ServeMux](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux).
 - [`internalshared/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/internalshared/)
   contains shared configuration objects used by Agent, Proxy, and Server,
   accessible to `vault.Core` as well.
 - [`physical/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/physical/)
   contains production quality physical storage backend implementations.
   This currently only includes Raft.
 - [`plugins/database/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/plugins/database/)
   contains the plugins for the database secrets engine to support creating
   short-lived dynamic credentials for these database types.
 - [`serviceregistration/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/serviceregistration/)
   contains helpers for supporting service registration against various
   providers. This is only utilized by OpenBao Server.
 - [`vault/`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/tree/main/vault/)
   contains the [Core](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/vault/core.go)
   of the server: this implements
   [barrier encryption](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/vault/barrier.go),
   [identity storage](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/vault/identity_store.go),
   [token storage](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/vault/token_store.go),
   and many `sys/` endpoint implementations.

Key dependencies of the server code are:

 - [`go-secure-stdlib`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-secure-stdlib) which
   is a collection of shared parsing and configuration utility libraries used
   by many plugins and the Core.
 - [`go-kms-wrapping`](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping) which
   implements auto-unseal for various providers (such as Transit or GCP).
 - [`raft`](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft) which implements the core Raft
   storage backend.
 - [`openbao-template`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-template) which
   implements templating for OpenBao Agent.
