# `/sys/rotate/keyring`

The `/sys/rotate/keyring` endpoint is used to rotate the encryption key.

Old endpoint format of `/sys/rotate` is still supported, although `/sys/rotate/keyring` is preferred.

## Rotate encryption key

This endpoint triggers a rotation of the backend encryption key. This is the key
that is used to encrypt data written to the storage backend, which is not provided
to the operators. This operation is done online. Future values are encrypted with
the new key, while old values are decrypted with previous encryption key.

This path requires `sudo` capability in addition to `update`.
