# Auth methods

Auth methods are the components in OpenBao that perform authentication and are
responsible for assigning identity and a set of policies to a user. In all cases,
OpenBao will enforce authentication as part of the request processing. In most cases,
OpenBao will delegate the authentication administration and decision to the relevant configured
external auth method (e.g., Kubernetes).

Having multiple auth methods enables you to use an auth method that makes the
most sense for your use case of OpenBao and your organization.

For example, on developer machines, the [Userpass](/docs/auth/userpass)
is easiest to use. But for servers the [AppRole](/docs/auth/approle)
method is the recommended choice.

To learn more about authentication, see the
[authentication concepts page](/docs/concepts/auth).

## Enabling/Disabling auth methods

Auth methods can be enabled/disabled using the CLI or the API.

```shell-session
$ bao auth enable userpass
```

When enabled, auth methods are similar to [secrets engines](/docs/secrets):
they are mounted within the OpenBao mount table and can be accessed
and configured using the standard read/write API. All auth methods are mounted underneath the `auth/` prefix.

By default, auth methods are mounted to `auth/<type>`. For example, if you
enable "ldap", then you can interact with it at `auth/ldap`. However, this
path is customizable, allowing users with advanced use cases to mount a single
auth method multiple times.

```shell-session
$ bao auth enable -path=my-login userpass
```

When an auth method is disabled, all users authenticated via that method are
automatically logged out.

## External auth method considerations

When using an external auth method (e.g., Kubernetes), OpenBao will call the external service
at the time of authentication and for subsequent token renewals. If the status
of an entity changes in the external system (e.g., an account expires or is
disabled), OpenBao denies requests to **renew** tokens associated with the entity.
However, any existing token remain valid for the original grant period unless
they are explicitly revoked within OpenBao. Operators should set appropriate
[token TTLs](/docs/concepts/tokens#the-general-case) when using external
authN methods.

## Authentication Flows

There are two primary flows client applications use to talk to OpenBao.

### Standard Authentication

In this flow, client applications first make calls to specific login
endpoints, specific to the desired auth engine. These operations return an
auth token which are subsequently passed in the `X-Vault-Token` header on
following authenticated requests. This token has an expiration and may be
renewable. Any leases created by the subsequent authenticated requests are
associated with this token and are usually revoked when the token expires or
is revoked.

### Inline Authentication

In contrast to [standard authentication](#standard-authentication), inline
authentication is sent with the main, authenticated request. No ahead-of-time
token acquisition occurs; an ephemeral token is created but not persisted to
storage so authenticated operations which incur leases will not work and will
result in an error (with any lease created being immediately revoked). This
token will not be returned to the client application.

To use, specify the following headers:

 - `X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Path`, the path to authenticate against; required.
 - `X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Operation`, the operation to use; optional,
   defaults to `update`.
 - `X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Namespace`, the namespace to authenticate against;
   optional, defaults to the `X-Vault-Namespace` value if specified.
 - `X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Parameter-*`, user-specified parameters taking a
   URL-Safe Base64 encoded JSON object having a `key` and `value`
   parameter to inject into the request data.


:::warning

Login calls made with this authentication mechanism must be one-shot: MFA
(without the use of `X-Vault-MFA`) and other multi-step auth schemes such as
certain OIDC flows will not work.

:::

If an auth method imposes a number of uses on source identity information,
such as AppRole's `secret_id_num_uses`, each request with inline
authentication will count against those limits separately.

This improves scalability: standard authentication incurs several storage
writes as a result of successful authentication and thus must happen on the
active node. Additionally, these persisted entries are refreshed on leadership
changes, which may cause churn and excessive disk and CPU usage. Depending on
the workload patterns, a client application using inline authentication may
result in a more performant OpenBao instance than standard authentication.
