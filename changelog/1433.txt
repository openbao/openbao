```release-note:feature
**Inline, Write-less Authentication**: support passing authentication
  information inline with the desired main operation to avoid the need
  for separate authentication calls, storing and maintaining tokens. This
  authentication form will not work with operations that create leases.
  In this form of authentication, no storage writes occur as a result of
  authentication allowing its use on future read-enabled standby nodes.
