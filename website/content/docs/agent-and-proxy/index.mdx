# OpenBao agent and OpenBao proxy

A valid client token must accompany most requests to OpenBao. This
includes all API requests, as well as via the OpenBao CLI and other libraries.
Therefore, OpenBao clients must first authenticate with OpenBao to acquire a token.
OpenBao provides several authentication methods to assist in
delivering this initial token.

![Client authentication](/img/diagram-openbao-agent.png)

If the client can securely acquire the token, all subsequent requests (e.g., request
database credentials, read key/value secrets) are processed based on the
trust established by a successful authentication.

This means that client application must invoke the OpenBao API to authenticate
with OpenBao and manage the acquired token, in addition to invoking the API to
request secrets from OpenBao. This implies code changes to client applications
along with additional testing and maintenance of the application.

The following code example implements OpenBao API to authenticate with OpenBao
through [AppRole auth method](/docs/auth/approle#code-example), and then uses
the returned client token to read secrets at `kv-v2/data/creds`.

```go
package main

import (
    ...snip...
    openbao "github.com/openbao/openbao/api/v2"
)

// Fetches a key-value secret (kv-v2) after authenticating via AppRole
func getSecretWithAppRole() (string, error) {
    config := openbao.DefaultConfig()

    client := openbao.NewClient(config)
    wrappingToken := os.ReadFile("path/to/wrapping-token")
    unwrappedToken := client.Logical().Unwrap(strings.TrimSuffix(string(wrappingToken), "\n"))

    secretID := unwrappedToken.Data["secret_id"]
    roleID := os.Getenv("APPROLE_ROLE_ID")

    params := map[string]interface{}{
        "role_id":   roleID,
        "secret_id": secretID,
    }
    resp := client.Logical().Write("auth/approle/login", params)
    client.SetToken(resp.Auth.ClientToken)

    secret, err := client.Logical().Read("kv-v2/data/creds")
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("unable to read secret: %w", err)
    }

    data := secret.Data["data"].(map[string]interface{})

    ...snip...
}
```

For some OpenBao deployments, making (and maintaining) these changes to
applications may not be a problem, and may actually be preferred. This may be
applied to scenarios where you have a small number of applications, or you want
to keep strict, customized control over how each application interacts with
OpenBao. However, in other situations where you have a large number of
applications, as in large enterprises, you may not have the resources or expertise
to update and maintain the OpenBao integration code for every application. When
third party applications are being deployed by the application, it is prohibited
to add the OpenBao integration code.

### Introduce OpenBao agent and OpenBao proxy to the workflow

[OpenBao Agent][openbaoagent] and [OpenBao Proxy][openbaoproxy] aim to remove this initial hurdle to adopt OpenBao by providing a
more scalable and simpler way for applications to integrate with OpenBao. OpenBao Agent can
obtain secrets and provide them to applications, and OpenBao Proxy can act as
a proxy between OpenBao and the application, optionally simplifying the authentication process
and caching requests.
