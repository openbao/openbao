# CVE Process

## Overview

The process has the following main phases:

1. Notification via security mailing list (preferred) or issue (not
   preferential unless existing disclosure exists).
2. Confirmation of issue: 7 days
3. Patch development and release: 90 days

Total time: 97 days.

### Notification Mechanisms

OpenBao tracks the following sources as valid vulnerability notification
channels:

1. The security mailing list, `openbao-security@lists.openssf.org`. See
   [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/openbao/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
   This should be preferred, especially for embargoed issues.
2. The private repository issues, e.g., [`openbao/openbao`](https://github.com/openbao/dev-wg/security/advisories/new).
3. The HashiCorp Vault security bulletin, https://discuss.hashicorp.com/tag/security-vault/.

Reports by other mechanisms will be referred to the security mailing list and
not considered valid reports.

The security mailing list includes all active voting Dev WG members who have
opted in to participating in the security patching process, plus
representatives from the Linux Foundation for oversight. In-progress reports
will be kept confidential through the disclosure period, with need-to-know,
limited disclosure within participating organizations.

### Confirmation Process

A 7-day process from submission will determine the validity of the report. An
acknowledgement should be sent quickly by a triaging individual; all
subsequent communication with the reporter should include the mailing list. If
confirmed, a new security advisory should be acquired on GitHub with CVE
assignment. This will allow creation of a private, restricted repository with
limited visibility.

The security list members should coordinate triage and assign a patch
developer.

### Patch Development and Release

From the confirmation of the vulnerability, we seek to have a maximum 90-day
window or less to patch all vulnerabilities in a released version of OpenBao.
In instances where we can get a patch out sooner, we should endeavor to do
so.

For High or Critical severity issues, we should issue an announcement on all
relevant channels one week before release, indicating that a security release
is eminent. These security issues would be sufficient to trigger a dedicated
release of the last patch series or a new minor release if applicable.

Patch development should remain confidential and limited to active mailing
list members. Additional members may be added on a one-off basis, as needed
for expertise and development capacity, given reasonable consensus among the
security list members.

Embargoed patches will not be disclosed outside of member organizations.
Member organizations may run patches on their own infrastructure, e.g., for
internal or publicly accessible instances, but may not ship patch sources or
patched binaries to third-party organizations.
