# Release checklist

This checklist was created after the v2.0.0 release in order to facilitate
a better release process going forward.

## Pre-release checklist

 - [ ] Designate a release manager and assign them this issue.
 - [ ] Clone this template into a GitHub release issue.
 - [ ] Identify target release version (major, minor, or patch) and milestones
       (alpha, beta, ...).
 - [ ] Identify and communicate the release timeline.
      - [ ] Community meeting
      - [ ] OpenBao Core Mailing list
      - [ ] TSC Mailing List
      - [ ] Zulip
      - [ ] GitHub milestones
 - [ ] Ensure relevant features and bug fixes are present in the release.
 - [ ] Check generated changelog via `make release-changelog` and make any
       necessary updates to entries.
 - [ ] Draft release notification announcement.
 - [ ] Tag new API versions (including in auth plugins), if necessary. Minor
       version numbers follow core release version numbers but patch numbers
       simply increment; there are no beta releases of API except for new
       major versions of core.
      - [ ] When bumping API major version, ensure `api/go.mod` is first
            updated to the new version.
 - [ ] Update first-party external dependencies to use new API modules, if
       necessary.
      - [ ] [`go-kms-wrapping`](https://github.com/openbao/go-kms-wrapping)
      - [ ] Tag new `go-kms-wrapping` module versions. Only components which
            have changed need to be tagged. Note that version numbers do not
            follow core releases.
      - [ ] Update SDK and main module to use new `go-kms-wrapping` version.
 - [ ] Update SDK to use the new API version, if necessary.
 - [ ] Tag new SDK version, if necessary. Minor version numbers follow core
       release version numbers but patch numbers simply increment; there are
       no beta releases of SDK except for new major versions of core.
      - [ ] When bumping SDK major version, ensure `sdk/go.mod` is first updated
            to the new version.
 - [ ] Update first-party external dependencies to use new API & SDK
       modules, if necessary.
      - [ ] [`go-secure-stdlib`](https://github.com/openbao/go-secure-stdlib)
      - [ ] [`openbao-template`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-template)
 - [ ] Update API, SDK, and first-party external dependencies in main
       `go.mod`. While API and SDK always use the built-in version, the
       first-party external modules still use the external version and thus
       must be updated.
 - [ ] Update external dependencies with vulnerabilities. Major changes should
       be done earlier in the release cycle to give the community time to find
       any breaking issues.
 - [ ] Update container image base layer versions.
 - [ ] Update Go version pinning in `/.go-release` and in the the `toolchain`
       directive in `go.mod`; go-releaser uses this version via a custom
       (in-repo) `set-up-go` action.

## Release checklist

 - [ ] Open PR to update `CHANGELOG.md` and release notes on website.
      - [ ] Patch versions should go in the corresponding minor version's
            existing page; new minor and major versions should get their own
            page.
      - [ ] If doing a patch release off an existing major or minor release
            branch, update the `main` repository's `CHANGELOG.md` file as
            well, ordering it according to version number.
      - [ ] Update docs versions in `doc-versions.json` if necessary
 - [ ] Tag release commit (`CHANGELOG.md` change).
 - [ ] Start [release workflow](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/actions/workflows/release.yml):
       select target tag, and set applicable pre-release/latest set
       (pre-releases should not be marked latest on GitHub).
 - [ ] Manually upload [GPG signing key](https://openbao.org/assets/openbao-gpg-pub-20240618.asc)
       to the release artifacts.
 - [ ] Spot-check release artifacts:
      - [ ] Container images work.
      - [ ] Linux binaries work.
      - [ ] Website download page.
      - [ ] CoSign and GPG Signatures on binaries.
 - [ ] In the event of issues during the release that require new tags to be
       pushed, write a postmortem indicating why.
 - [ ] Share release notification announcement:
      - [ ] OpenBao Core mailing list (cc TSC mailing list)
      - [ ] GitHub Discussions
      - [ ] Link from Zulip
      - [ ] Mention in next community meeting & TSC meetings.
 - [ ] Close the release milestone on GitHub.
 - [ ] For large releases, work with the OpenSSF for a release blog post.
 - [ ] For new major or minor versions, create a `release/<version>` branch
       after the first release on the minor series (including beta and other
       pre-release branches). Future features should target the next release
       (`main` branch) but bug and security fixes can be backported.
      - [ ] Update docs versions in `doc-versions.json` if necessary
