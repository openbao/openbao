# read

The `read` command reads data from OpenBao at the given path (wrapper command for
HTTP GET). You can use the command to read secrets, generate dynamic
credentials, get configuration details, and more.

## Examples

Read entity details of a given ID:

```shell-session
$ bao read identity/entity/id/2f09126d-d161-abb8-2241-555886491d97
```

### API versus CLI

Assuming that you have K/V version 2 (`kv-v2`) secrets engine enabled at
`secret/`, the following command reads secrets at the `secret/data/customers`
API path:

```shell-session
$ bao read secret/data/customers
```

This is equivalent to:

```shell-session
$ curl --request GET --header "X-Vault-Token: $OPENBAO_TOKEN" \
    $OPENBAO_ADDR/v1/secret/data/customers
```

Since K/V secrets engine is a commonly used feature, OpenBao CLI provides the
[`kv`](/docs/commands/kv) command. Read secrets from the `secret/data/customers`
path using the `kv` CLI command:

```shell-session
$ bao kv get -mount=secret customers
```

:::info

**Comparison:** All three commands retrieve the same data, but display the
output in a different format. By default, `bao read` prints output in
key-value format. The `curl` command prints the response in JSON. Since the
`kv` command is designed to handle operations associated with K/V secrets
engine, it prints the output in more structured format that is easy to read.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", "yaml", or "raw". This can also be specified
  via the `BAO_FORMAT` environment variable.

For a full list of examples and paths, please see the documentation that
corresponds to the secrets engine in use.
