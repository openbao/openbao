# `/sys/key-status`

The `/sys/key-status` endpoint is used to query info about the current
encryption key of OpenBao.

## Get encryption key status

This endpoint returns information about the current encryption key used by
OpenBao.

| Method | Path              |
| :----- | :---------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/key-status` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/key-status

```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "term": 3,
  "install_time": "2015-05-29T14:50:46.223692553-07:00",
  "encryptions": 74718331
}
```

The `term` parameter is the sequential key number. `install_time` is the
time that encryption key was installed. `encryptions` is the estimated
number of encryptions made by the key including those on other cluster
nodes.  

Note that the estimated encryption count is aggregated from secondary 
OpenBao nodes to the primary but not in the other direction.  Thus the
count only accurately reflects the cluster-wide estimate when queried
on the primary.
