# Support inline authentication for non-leased operations

## Summary

Inline authentication allows direct requests to OpenBao to perform actions
which are authenticated by including login information with the action
request. This authentication occurs prior to the main request body being
processed, with the caveat that the generated token is not stored. This allows
for better scalability to future standby nodes which support read-request
processing, by avoiding write operations that occur in the course of regular
login requests.

## Problem Statement

Authentication is one of the few non-scalable requests in OpenBao; while
[theoretical work to allow per-namespace storage and active leader
designation](https://openbao.org/blog/vision-for-namespaces/) would allow
scaling, this still requires all login requests be processed by the active
leader. Certain access patterns, such as listing or reading from K/V or
issuing certificates without storing, are otherwise broadly horizontally
scalable. Furthermore, sometimes this authentication is discarded; such as
when fetching secrets from a CI/CD pipeline, each pipeline run will start
with a fresh token as usually authentication is tied to some parent JWT and
no authentication information or secrets are persisted across runs, usually
due to lack of persistent, secure storage and reproducibility.

Scaling login requests thus becomes important depending on the workload
patterns.

Using the standard authentication flow incurs three storage write operations:

Two to the token store:

- `sys/token/id/{id}`
- `sys/token/accessor/{accessor}`

and one to the expiration manager:

- `sys/expire/id/auth/{mount_uuid}/login/{id}`

As leadership changes in a cluster, the standby nodes read these entries
to check for expirations of tokens and thus incur storage pressure on
leadership changes. Switching to inline, writeless tokens will reduce this
storage pressure significantly, depending on workload patterns.

This also helps integration for developers: rather than having to manage a
specific OpenBao identity or token, the authentication source can instead
be directly used on many requests and workflows. Confusion, such as expressed
by a few users on Matrix about authentication, can be avoided; an auth method
can be configured and "tokens" can be ignored in favor of inline
authentication.

We suggest calling the existing, persistent auth flow **standard**
authentication and the new flow **inline** authentication.

## User-facing Description

Inline authentication requires the user be able to modify headers on the
request; no other modification to the request body is necessary. The
`X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Path` header indicates that inline authentication is
to be performed; one or more headers beginning with the prefix
`X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Parameter-` specify parameters. These are URL-safe,
without padding, Base64 encoded JSON encoded maps of the form:

```
{
    "key": "<name of key>",
    "value": <value of key
}
```

An optional header, `X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Operation`, allows controlling
the operation type; this defaults to `update` by default.

These headers are collected and form the basis of a new request:

```
[update or value of X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Operation] /auth/<value of X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Path>`
{
    ... <key field of X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Parameter- >: <value field of X-Vault-Inline-Auth-Parameter-> ...
}
```

In the event the request generates a lease when inline authentication is used,
it is immediately revoked and an error returned.

The generated token is not returned to the user as it would not be valid on
subsequent requests.

## Technical Description

This hooks into `core.switchedLockHandleRequest(...)` called from
`core.HandleRequest(...)` and thus has fairly broad support. Before executing
the given request, we check for inline authentication in
`core.handleInlineAuth(...)`, supplementing the original request with the
result of authentication. Authentication is performed by also calling
`core.handleCancelableRequest(...)` (the same method the main request is
subsequently handled by), resulting in audit logs for both the authentication
and the main request. Because the main request is modified to have
authentication, audit logs correctly point to the inline authentication as if
it occurred just prior to the request.

Various storage entries in the token store and expiration manager are created
in memory but not written. These are attached to the response from the inline
authentication, to be attached to the inbound request. As this inline
authentication response is not returned to the caller, it remains private.
Coupled with the fact that it is not persisted to storage, even if this token
were to leak somehow, it would not be useful outside of this immediate request
context.

### Integration in Ecosystem

Other projects in the ecosystem, such as OpenBao Agent, and k8s secrets operator
will need to be updated to support this. Each auth method will need to be
checked for support. This does not need to occur at the same time as the main
implementation but should be saved as future work.

Note that OpenBao Auto-Authing Proxy may not be able to function with this
change; it will need to gracefully handle leases and will be likely used with
many requests so the benefits are minimal.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Improving the efficacy of future horizontal scalability is important; this
change helps with that. This improves overall performance as well, if inline
authentication is used more broadly by reducing the total number of storage
operations made by OpenBao.

One alternative would be for applications to use longer-lived authentication;
in many workloads, this is not possible.

## Downsides

The complexity of this change is rather small (~300LOC without tests).
However, it does introduce a few new code paths as expected by a change of
this nature.

## Security Implications

Authentication will still be performed; this is equivalent to a three-request
operation:

 1. Authenticate to OpenBao.
 2. Issue actual request.
 3. Revoke token.

However, the application does not see the token ever so this change helps to
limit the scope of exposure. Instead, the root secret is directly passed to
OpenBao for authentication on each request.

Importantly, because we incur only a single inbound request, we count only
once in the quota system. This should largely be fine: requests sent in the
authentication headers are limited to unauthenticated requests as we'll deny
requests with both inline auth and explicit tokens. At most, this would allow
a 2x request amplification against unauthenticated endpoints, but the benefits
of not storing tokens on standard requests will greatly improve performance
with broad adoption.

## User/Developer Experience

This change is backwards compatible with previous API versions, including to
HashiCorp's Vault API client. As long as the operator can modify each
request's headers or authentication values are sufficiently static, this
should work with third-party clients, especially those that expect to talk
to Agent for transparent authentication.

## Unresolved Questions

Not clear is if header-size limiting become an issue for certain request
types. This will likely only be understood in the context of understanding
of middleware between OpenBao and the client. It is certainly conceivable that
certain authentication formats will require large individual parameters (like
large JWTs) and certain middleware implementations will constrain this beyond
a useful value.
