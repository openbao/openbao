    controller manager which performs RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using SubjectAccessReviews.

    - `image` - Image sets the repo and tag of the kube-rbac-proxy image to use for the controller.

      - `repository` (`string: gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy`)

      - `tag` (`string: v0.14.1`)

    - `resources` (`map`) - Configures the default resources for the kube rbac proxy container.
      For more information on configuring resources, see the K8s documentation:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

      - `limits` 

        - `cpu` (`string: 500m`)

    Example:
    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: pull-secret-name-1
      - name: pull-secret-name-2
    ```
    Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry.

  - `extraLabels` - Extra labels to attach to the deployment. This should be formatted as a YAML object (map)

  - `annotations` - This value defines additional annotations for the deployment. This should be formatted as a YAML object (map)

  - `manager` - Settings related to the vault-secrets-operator container.

    - `image` - Image sets the repo and tag of the vault-secrets-operator image to use for the controller.

      - `repository` (`string: hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator`)

      - `tag` (`string: 0.3.1`)

    - `clientCache` - Configures the client cache which is used by the controller to cache (and potentially persist) vault tokens that
      are the result of using the VaultAuthMethod. This enables re-use of Vault Tokens
      throughout their TTLs as well as the ability to renew.
      Persistence is only useful in the context of Dynamic Secrets, so "none" is an okay default.

      - `persistenceModel` (`string: ""`) - Defines the `-client-cache-persistence-model` which caches+persists vault tokens.
        Valid values are:
        "none" - in-memory client cache is used, no tokens are persisted.
        "direct-unencrypted" - in-memory client cache is persisted, unencrypted. This is NOT recommended for any production workload.
        "direct-encrypted" - in-memory client cache is persisted encrypted using the Vault Transit engine.
        Note: It is strongly encouraged to not use the setting of "direct-unencrypted" in
        production due to the potential of vault tokens being leaked as they would then be stored
        in clear text.

        default: "none"

      - `cacheSize` (`integer: ""`) - Defines the size of the in-memory LRU cache *in entries*, that is used by the client cache controller.
        Larger numbers will increase memory usage by the controller, lower numbers will cause more frequent evictions
        of the client cache which can result in additional Vault client counts.

        default: 10000

      - `storageEncryption` - StorageEncryption provides the necessary configuration to encrypt the client storage
        cache within Kubernetes objects using (required) Vault Transit Engine.
        This should only be configured when client cache persistence with encryption is enabled and
        will deploy an additional VaultAuthMethod to be used by the Vault Transit Engine.
        E.g. when `controller.manager.clientCache.persistenceModel=direct-encrypted`
        Supported Vault authentication methods for the Transit Auth method are: jwt, appRole,
        aws, and kubernetes.
        Typically, there should only ever be one VaultAuth configured with
        StorageEncryption in the Cluster.

        - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - toggles the deployment of the Transit VaultAuthMethod CR.

        - `vaultConnectionRef` (`string: default`) - Vault Connection Ref to be used by the Transit VaultAuthMethod.

## Helm chart examples

The below `config.yaml` results in a single replica installation of the Vault Secrets Operator
with a default vault connection and auth method custom resource deployed.
It expects a local Vault installation within the kubernetes cluster
accessible via `http://vault.default.svc.cluster.local:8200` with TLS disabled,
and a [Vault Auth Method](/docs/auth/kubernetes) to be setup against the `default` ServiceAccount.


```yaml
# config.yaml

defaultVaultConnection:
  enabled: true
defaultAuthMethod:
  enabled: true

```

## Customizing the helm chart

If you need to extend the Helm chart with additional options, we recommend using a third-party tool,
such as [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) using the project repo `config/` path
in the [vault-secrets-operator](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator) project.
