# Kubernetes secrets engine

:::warning

**Note**: This engine can use external X.509 certificates as part of TLS or signature validation.
   Verifying signatures against X.509 certificates that use SHA-1 is deprecated and is no longer
   usable without a workaround. See the
   [deprecation FAQ](/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1)
   for more information.

:::

The Kubernetes Secrets Engine for OpenBao generates Kubernetes service account tokens, and
optionally service accounts, role bindings, and roles. The created service account tokens have
a configurable TTL and any objects created are automatically deleted when the OpenBao lease expires.

For each lease, OpenBao will create a service account token attached to the
defined service account. The service account token is returned to the caller.

To learn more about service accounts in Kubernetes, visit the
[Kubernetes service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)
and [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
documentation.

:::warning

**Note:** We do not recommend using tokens created by the Kubernetes Secrets Engine to
   authenticate with the [OpenBao Kubernetes Auth Method](/docs/auth/kubernetes). This will
   generate many unique identities in OpenBao that will be hard to manage.

:::

## Setup

The Kubernetes Secrets Engine must be configured in advance before it
can perform its functions. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

1. By default, OpenBao will connect to Kubernetes using its own service account.
   If using the [standard Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm), this service account
   is created automatically by default and named after the Helm release (often `openbao`, but this can be
   configured via the Helm value `server.serviceAccount.name`).

   It's necessary to ensure that the service account OpenBao uses will have permissions to manage
   service account tokens, and optionally manage service accounts, roles, and role bindings. These
   permissions can be managed using a Kubernetes role or cluster role. The role is attached to the
   OpenBao service account with a role binding or cluster role binding.

   For example, a minimal cluster role to create service account tokens is:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRole
   metadata:
     name: k8s-minimal-secrets-abilities
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["serviceaccounts/token"]
     verbs: ["create"]
   ```

   Similarly, you can create a more permissive cluster role with full permissions to manage tokens,
   service accounts, bindings, and roles.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRole
   metadata:
     name: k8s-full-secrets-abilities
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["serviceaccounts", "serviceaccounts/token"]
     verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
   - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
     resources: ["rolebindings", "clusterrolebindings"]
     verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
   - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
     resources: ["roles", "clusterroles"]
     verbs: ["bind", "escalate", "create", "update", "delete"]
   ```

   Create this role in Kubernetes (e.g., with `kubectl apply -f`).

   Moreover, if you want to use label selection to configure the namespaces on which a role can act,
   you will need to grant OpenBao permissions to read namespaces.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRole
   metadata:
     name: k8s-full-secrets-abilities-with-labels
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["namespaces"]
     verbs: ["get"]
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["serviceaccounts", "serviceaccounts/token"]
     verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
   - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
     resources: ["rolebindings", "clusterrolebindings"]
     verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
   - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
     resources: ["roles", "clusterroles"]
     verbs: ["bind", "escalate", "create", "update", "delete"]
   ```

:::warning

 **Note:** Getting the right permissions for OpenBao will require some trial and error most
      likely since Kubernetes has strict protections against privilege escalation. You can read more
      in the
      [Kubernetes RBAC documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#privilege-escalation-prevention-and-bootstrapping).

:::

:::warning

 **Note:** Protect the OpenBao service account, especially if you use broader permissions for it,
      as it is essentially a cluster administrator account.

:::

1. Create a role binding to bind the role to OpenBao's service account and grant OpenBao permission
   to manage tokens.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: openbao-token-creator-binding
   roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: k8s-minimal-secrets-abilities
   subjects:
   - kind: ServiceAccount
     name: openbao
     namespace: openbao
   ```

   For more information on Kubernetes roles, service accounts, bindings, and tokens, visit the
   [Kubernetes RBAC documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

1. If OpenBao will not be automatically managing roles or service accounts (see
   [Automatically Managing Roles and Service Accounts](#automatically-managing-roles-and-service-accounts)),
   then you will need to set up a service account that OpenBao will issue tokens for.

:::warning

 **Note**: It is highly recommended that the service account that OpenBao issues tokens for
      is **NOT** the same service account that OpenBao itself uses.

:::

   The examples we will use will under the namespace `test`, which you can create if it does not
   already exist.

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl create namespace test
   namespace/test created
   ```

   Here is a simple set up of a service account, role, and role binding in the Kubernetes `test`
   namespace with basic permissions we will use for this document:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: test-service-account-with-generated-token
     namespace: test
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Role
   metadata:
     name: test-role-list-pods
     namespace: test
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["pods"]
     verbs: ["list"]
   ---
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: test-role-abilities
     namespace: test
   roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: Role
     name: test-role-list-pods
   subjects:
   - kind: ServiceAccount
     name: test-service-account-with-generated-token
     namespace: test
   ```

   You can create these objects with `kubectl apply -f`.

1. Enable the Kubernetes Secrets Engine:

   ```shell-session
   $ bao secrets enable kubernetes
   Success! Enabled the kubernetes Secrets Engine at: kubernetes/
   ```

   By default, the secrets engine will mount at the same name as the engine, i.e.,
   `kubernetes/` here. This can be changed by passing the `-path` argument when enabling.

1. Configure the mount point. An empty config is allowed.

   ```shell-session
   $ bao write -f kubernetes/config
   ```

   Configuration options are available as specified in the
   [API docs](/api-docs/secret/kubernetes).

1. You can now configure Kubernetes Secrets Engine to create an OpenBao role (**not** the same as a
   Kubernetes role) that can generate service account tokens for the given service account:

   ```shell-session
   $ bao write kubernetes/roles/my-role \
       allowed_kubernetes_namespaces="*" \
       service_account_name="test-service-account-with-generated-token" \
       token_default_ttl="10m"
   ```

## Generating credentials

After a user has authenticated to OpenBao and has sufficient permissions, a write to the
`creds` endpoint for the OpenBao role will generate and return a new service account token.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/creds/my-role \
    kubernetes_namespace=test

Key                        Value
â€“--                        -----
lease_id                   kubernetes/creds/my-role/31d771a6-...
lease_duration             10m0s
lease_renwable             false
service_account_name       test-service-account-with-generated-token
service_account_namespace  test
service_account_token      eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImlrUEE...
```

You can use the service account token above (`eyJHbG...`) with any Kubernetes API request that
its service account is authorized for (through role bindings).

```shell-session
$ curl -sk $(kubectl config view --minify -o 'jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.server}')/api/v1/namespaces/test/pods \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1Ni..."
{
  "kind": "PodList",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "resourceVersion": "1624"
  },
  "items": []
}
```

When the lease expires, you can verify that the token has been revoked.
```shell-session
$ curl -sk $(kubectl config view --minify -o 'jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.server}')/api/v1/namespaces/test/pods \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1Ni..."
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {},
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "reason": "Unauthorized",
  "code": 401
}
```

## TTL

Kubernetes service account tokens have a time-to-live (TTL). When a token expires it is
automatically revoked.

You can set a default (`token_default_ttl`) and a maximum TTL (`token_max_ttl`) when
creating or tuning the OpenBao role.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/roles/my-role \
    allowed_kubernetes_namespaces="*" \
    service_account_name="new-service-account-with-generated-token" \
    token_default_ttl="10m" \
    token_max_ttl="2h"
```

You can also set a TTL (`ttl`) when you generate the token from the credentials endpoint.
The TTL of the token will be given the default if not specified (and cannot exceed the
maximum TTL of the role, if present).

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/creds/my-role \
    kubernetes_namespace=test \
    ttl=20m

Key                        Value
â€“--                        -----
lease_id                   kubernetes/creds/my-role/31d771a6-...
lease_duration             20m0s
lease_renwable             false
service_account_name       new-service-account-with-generated-token
service_account_namespace  test
service_account_token      eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImlrUEE...
```


You can verify the token's TTL by decoding the JWT token and extracting the `iat`
(issued at) and `exp` (expiration time) claims.

```shell-session
$ echo 'eyJhbGc...' | cut -d'.' -f2 | base64 -d  | jq -r '.iat,.exp|todate'
2022-05-20T17:14:50Z
2022-05-20T17:34:50Z
```

## Audiences

Kubernetes service account tokens have audiences.

You can set default audiences (`token_default_audiences`) when creating or tuning the OpenBao role.
The Kubernetes cluster default audiences for service account tokens will be used if not specified.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/roles/my-role \
    allowed_kubernetes_namespaces="*" \
    service_account_name="new-service-account-with-generated-token" \
    token_default_audiences="custom-audience"
```

You can also set audiences (`audiences`) when you generate the token from the credentials endpoint.
The audiences of the token will be given the default audiences if not specified.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/creds/my-role \
    kubernetes_namespace=test \
    audiences="another-custom-audience"

Key                        Value
â€“--                        -----
lease_id                   kubernetes/creds/my-role/SriWQf0bPZ...
lease_duration             768h
lease_renwable             false
service_account_name       new-service-account-with-generated-token
service_account_namespace  test
service_account_token      eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImlrUEE...
```

You can verify the token's audiences by decoding the JWT.

```shell-session
$ echo 'eyJhbGc...' | cut -d'.' -f2 | base64 -d
{"aud":["another-custom-audience"]...
```

## Automatically managing roles and service accounts

When configuring the OpenBao role, you can pass in parameters to specify that you want to
automatically generate the Kubernetes service account and role binding,
and optionally generate the Kubernetes role itself.

If you want to configure the OpenBao role to use a pre-existing Kubernetes role, but generate
the service account and role binding automatically, you can set the `kubernetes_role_name`
parameter.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/roles/auto-managed-sa-role \
    allowed_kubernetes_namespaces="test" \
    kubernetes_role_name="test-role-list-pods"
```

:::warning

**Note**: OpenBao's service account will also need access to the resources it is granting
access to. This can be done for the examples above with `kubectl -n test create rolebinding --role test-role-list-pods --serviceaccount=openbao:openbao openbao-test-role-abilities`.
This is how Kubernetes prevents privilege escalation.
You can read more in the
[Kubernetes RBAC documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#privilege-escalation-prevention-and-bootstrapping).

:::

You can then get credentials with the automatically generated service account.
```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/creds/auto-managed-sa-role \
    kubernetes_namespace=test
Key                          Value
---                          -----
lease_id                     kubernetes/creds/auto-managed-sa-role/cujRLYjKZUMQk6dkHBGGWm67
lease_duration               768h
lease_renewable              false
service_account_name         v-token-auto-man-1653001548-5z6hrgsxnmzncxejztml4arz
service_account_namespace    test
service_account_token        eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1Ni...
```

Furthermore, OpenBao can also automatically create the role in addition to the service account and
role binding by specifying the `generated_role_rules` parameter, which accepts a set of JSON or YAML
rules for the generated role.

```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/roles/auto-managed-sa-and-role \
    allowed_kubernetes_namespaces="test" \
    generated_role_rules='{"rules":[{"apiGroups":[""],"resources":["pods"],"verbs":["list"]}]}'
```
You can then get credentials in the same way as before.
```shell-session
$ bao write kubernetes/creds/auto-managed-sa-and-role \
    kubernetes_namespace=test
Key                          Value
---                          -----
lease_id                     kubernetes/creds/auto-managed-sa-and-role/pehLtegoTP8vCkcaQozUqOHf
lease_duration               768h
lease_renewable              false
service_account_name         v-token-auto-man-1653002096-4imxf3ytjh5hbyro9s1oqdo3
service_account_namespace    test
service_account_token        eyJHbGci0iJSUzI1Ni...
```
