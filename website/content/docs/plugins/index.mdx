# Plugin system

OpenBao supports 3 types of plugins; auth methods, secret engines, and database
plugins. This concept allows both built-in and external plugins to be treated
like building blocks. Any plugin can exist at multiple different mount paths.
Different versions of a plugin may be at each location, with each version differing
from OpenBao's version.

A plugin is uniquely identified by its type (one of `secret`, `auth`, or
`database`), name (e.g. `kv`), and version (e.g `v1.0.0`). An empty version
implies either the built-in plugin or the single unversioned plugin that can
be registered.

See [Plugin Upgrade Procedure](../upgrading/plugins.mdx#plugin-upgrade-procedure)
for details on how to upgrade a built-in plugin in-place.

## Plugin distribution methods

### Built-In plugins

Built-in plugins are shipped with OpenBao, often for commonly used integrations,
and can be used without any prerequisite steps.

### External plugins

External plugins are not shipped with OpenBao and require additional operator
steps to be installed, configured, and registered with OpenBao before they can be
used.

To run an external plugin, a binary of the plugin is required. Plugin
binaries can be obtained from the [openbao-plugins](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugins) repository
or they can be [built from source](plugin-development.mdx#building-a-plugin-from-source). 
OpenBao also supports downloading and managing plugins distributed as OCI (Open
Container Initiative) images from container registries.  See the [OCI
Plugin](../configuration/plugins.mdx) configuration reference for complete
documentation.

OpenBao's external plugins are completely separate, standalone applications that
OpenBao executes and communicates with over RPC. Each time an OpenBao secret engine,
auth method, or database plugin is mounted, a new process is spawned. However,
plugins can be made to implement [plugin multiplexing](plugin-architecture.mdx#plugin-multiplexing)
to improve performance. Plugin multiplexing allows plugin processes to be
reused across all mounts of a given type.

## Plugin versioning

OpenBao supports managing, running and upgrading plugins using semantic version
information.

The plugin catalog optionally supports specifying a semantic version when
registering an external plugin. Multiple versions of a plugin can be registered
in the catalog simultaneously, and a version can be selected when mounting a
plugin or tuning an existing mount in-place.

If no version is specified when creating a new mount, the following precedence is used
for any available plugins whose type and name match:

* The plugin registered with no version
* The plugin with the most recent semantic version among any registered versions
* The plugin built into OpenBao

### Built-In versions

OpenBao will report a version for built-in plugins to indicate what version of the
plugin code got built into OpenBao as a dependency. For example:

```shell-session
$ bao plugin list secret
Name                Version
----                -------

```

The `bao` metadata identifier indicates that plugin's code was within the
OpenBao repo. For plugins within the OpenBao repo, OpenBao's own major, minor,
and patch versions are used to form the plugin version.

The `builtin` metadata identifier is reserved and cannot be used when
registering external plugins.
